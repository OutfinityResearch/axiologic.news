## What is Axiologic.news?

Axiologic.news is an experimental project by Sînică Alboaie, founder of Axiologic Research. It was born from the observation that we spend too much time navigating various news sources, trying to find the actual story amidst the noise of trolls and marketing fluff.

In the age of AI, we believe there's a better way. This project aims to deliver the essence of the news in a faster, more insightful format by:

*   Providing AI-generated summaries of the key information.
*   Analyzing comments from the original posts to extract relevant opinions and reactions, so you don't have to.

## Open Source & How to Contribute

This is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions! If you find the idea interesting, you can help by:

*   **Adding new sources:** Contribute configurations or direct URLs to files that are periodically updated with news from different perspectives.
*   **Improving the analysis:** Help us refine the way we process and present information.

The goal is to collaboratively build a platform that offers diverse and valuable insights into the daily news cycle.

## Monetization & Partnership Opportunity

The system is designed to support a small ad link or banner, which could be a way to monetize the work involved in preparing and serving news in this unique format.

We are currently seeking partners with marketing expertise to help us validate the concept. If the idea proves successful, we are open to creating a spinoff venture.
