      "**User Experience**: *\"For developers, Grok 2.5’s raw, unfiltered output style and X-platform integration could appeal to those building adversarial or humor-driven applications, but its lack of structured guardrails and outdated knowledge base make it a non-starter for enterprise or consumer-facing deployments without heavy post-processing.\"*",
