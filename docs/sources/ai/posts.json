      "The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, as demonstrated using the German Credit Dataset (1000 applicants), helps assess the discriminatory power of a credit risk model by quantifying the maximum separation between cumulative default and non-default rates, indicating model effectiveness in identifying risky borrowers.",
      "A weakness of relying solely on the KS statistic is that while it shows model strength (with thresholds of <20, 20-40, 50-70 representing weak, acceptable, and good models respectively),  the ultimate approval threshold isn't determined by the KS value alone but considers additional factors like risk appetite and regulatory constraints.",
      "The author uses logistic regression on the German Credit Dataset, a publicly available dataset with 20 features describing 1000 loan applicants, to illustrate the calculation and interpretation of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, achieving a KS value of 0.530 at a probability of 0.2928 in their example."

The system also allows doctors to see significantly more patients.",
    "reactions": [
      "Akido Labs' ScopeAI system, using LLMs like Meta's Llama and Anthropic's Claude, aims to increase doctor productivity four- to fivefold by handling the cognitive aspects of medical visits, potentially improving access to care, especially for Medicaid patients as exemplified by its use in treating opioid addiction within 24 hours for the homeless.",
      "A significant risk is automation bias, where doctors may over-rely on ScopeAI's recommendations, potentially leading to misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment, particularly concerning given the lack of direct doctor-patient interaction in many cases, and the absence of rigorous comparative studies on patient outcomes.",
      "Akido's system achieves a 92% success rate in including the correct diagnosis within its top three recommendations when tested on historical data, but this internal metric lacks external validation through comparison with traditional appointment methods."
