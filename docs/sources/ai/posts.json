    "essence": "Summary: AI Stocks Face a Reality Check as Nvidia’s Growth Slows Nvidia’s latest earnings report revealed a sharp slowdown in AI-related revenue growth—down from 41% in Q1 to just 3% in Q2—sending its stock tumbling. This marks a critical inflection point for AI stocks, as investors demand concrete returns beyond hype. What’s new?",
    "reactions": [
      "Contrarian Perspective: \"Nvidia’s lack of a 'wow' factor suggests either overhyped expectations or incremental improvements masked as breakthroughs—real innovation would have been harder to dismiss, even if incremental.\" (Based on skepticism from tech analysts about Nvidia’s recent AI announcements lacking transformative leaps.)",
      "Business/Industry Impact: \"If Nvidia’s tech is genuinely incremental, competitors like AMD or startups could exploit the gap, but if the market overreacted, a correction could create buying opportunities for long-term AI infrastructure plays.\" (Derived from investor discussions on whether Nvidia’s valuation is now more realistic or undervalued.)",
      "Opportunities View: \"For developers and enterprises, this could mean cheaper, more accessible AI hardware soon, even if Nvidia’s stock stumbles—real-world adoption may outpace Wall Street’s short-term pessimism.\" (Inspired by comments from AI practitioners noting that hardware commoditization often follows market corrections.)"

    "essence": "Google’s AI Energy Use: A Tiny Query, a Big Misunderstanding Google recently revealed that a single query to its Gemini AI app consumes about 0.24 watt-hours of electricity—roughly equivalent to running a microwave for one second. While this seems negligible, the number is being misinterpreted as proof that AI’s energy demands aren’t a concern. The reality is more nuanced.",
