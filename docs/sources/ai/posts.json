Unlike generic guides, it provides a concrete, optimized workflow—using criteria like AIC, BIC, and Mallows’ Cₚ—to systematically add or remove predictors, reducing overfitting while improving interpretability. Why It Matters: Stepwise selection is not new, but this implementation stands out by: 1.",

This isn’t just another AI add-on—it’s a targeted move to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) streamline workflows without relying on expensive cloud services. What’s New?",
    "reactions": [
      "Contrarian Perspective: While Synology’s AI integration claims novelty, skeptics argue the features (e.g., document summarization, smart search) are incremental, leveraging existing open-source models rather than breakthroughs—raising questions about true innovation beyond marketing buzz.",
      "Business/Industry Impact: Analysts note Synology’s move could disrupt SMB-focused office suites by bundling AI tools at lower costs, but success hinges on seamless integration and avoiding vendor lock-in, as competitors like Microsoft and Google dominate enterprise AI workflows.",
      "Opportunities View: For SMEs, this could democratize AI access, offering cost-effective alternatives to enterprise solutions, but users warn that real-world utility depends on Synology’s ability to train models on domain-specific data, not just generic AI capabilities."

    "essence": "Summary: AI-Powered DevSecOps Tools Are Shifting Application Security from Reactive to Predictive A new wave of AI-driven DevSecOps vendors is transforming how organizations detect and mitigate security risks in software development. Unlike traditional tools that rely on static rules or manual reviews, these platforms use machine learning to analyze code, dependencies, and runtime behavior in real time—identifying vulnerabilities before they become exploits. What’s new?",
