      ") Skeptic check: \"The AI analysis relies on unverified 'short-term plans' from July 2025, with no cited sources or model transparency.",
      ") Next action if interested: \"Check Sangoma’s Q3 2025 earnings call transcript (likely filed via SEC) to validate AI claims about revenue growth."

      ") Next action if interested: Try the open-source CASI-Ensemble toolkit (GitHub link in comments) to benchmark model combinations against a baseline like linear regression on a 5-year backtest."
