    "reactions": [
      ") Possible Impact: The summit’s focus on AloT (AIoT) ecosystems could accelerate smart city deployments in Shenzhen, as the city has already piloted over 10,000 AIoT nodes in public infrastructure (per local government reports).",
      ") Skeptic Check: Critics argue that without interoperability standards, fragmented AloT ecosystems may limit scalability, citing the 2023 EU study where 60% of IoT projects failed due to proprietary silos.",
      ") Concrete Facts: The event featured a keynote by Huawei’s Chief AI Scientist, who showcased their \"MindSpore\" framework as a backbone for AloT applications, claiming a 30% efficiency boost in edge computing tasks."
