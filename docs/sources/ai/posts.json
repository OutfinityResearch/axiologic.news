    "essence": "1) What’s new: Synthesia’s AI avatars now have hyperrealistic expressions and will soon enable real-time interactions, while China’s solar exports ($40B in 2024) dwarf the US’s ($69M), highlighting America’s policy-driven lag in clean energy. 2) Why it matters: AI avatars blur human-machine boundaries, affecting media, marketing, and social trust; Trump’s fossil-fuel policies hinder US climate competitiveness, benefiting China. 3) Evidence/caveats: Synthesia’s model launched in August 2025; China’s 2024 solar exports (NYT).",

      ") Possible Impact: Synthesia’s hyperrealistic AI avatars, like the author’s clone, could blur the line between human and synthetic interactions, potentially eroding trust in digital media and deepening societal unease about AI’s role in communication.",
      ") Skeptic Check: China’s unused AI data centers highlight the risk of overinvestment in AI infrastructure, as falling GPU prices and shifting market dynamics may leave facilities financially stranded despite initial hype.",
      ") Concrete Fact: In 2024, China exported $40 billion worth of solar panels, while the U.S. shipped just $69 million, underscoring its dominant lead in clean energy—a gap worsened by U.S. policies favoring fossil fuels (NYT)."
