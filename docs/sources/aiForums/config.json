Prefer threads with rich, top‑voted comments (>=150 chars) and many participants. Skip simple questions, rants, memes. If few qualify, return fewer than requested.",
    "essencePrompt": "Discussion synthesis (80–120 words): 1) Context (what the thread is about), 2) The strongest pro argument (quote or paraphrase from a top comment), 3) The strongest counterpoint (quote or paraphrase), 4) One useful datapoint or resource mentioned, 5) What a reader can do/learn next. If comments lack substance, return: INSUFFICIENT DISCUSSION SIGNAL.",
    "perspectivesPrompt": "Use actual top comments when possible. Return three one‑sentence perspectives: 1) Top comment — distilled point, 2) Practitioner — concrete tip or gotcha, 3) Skeptic — specific critique. No platitudes. If no meaningful comments: return exactly 'No meaningful perspectives found.'"
