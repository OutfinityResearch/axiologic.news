This rise, higher than expected, is driven by the rising cost of government energy policies rather than wholesale price fluctuations, which have actually fallen by 2% over the past three months.

      ") Market reaction and fundamentals: The imposition of 50% tariffs on key Global South economies like Brazil, India, and China is likely to disrupt supply chains, increase costs for US consumers, and force affected nations to seek alternative trade partners, potentially accelerating de-dollarization efforts.",
      ") Strategic implications for competitors/customers: Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy risks alienating long-standing US allies, pushing them toward stronger economic cooperation within blocs like BRICS, while China stands to gain geopolitical influence as a preferred trading partner for nations targeted by US tariffs.",
      ") Risks and scenarios over the next 1–3 quarters: If resistance from the Global South solidifies, the US could face retaliatory measures, trade diversions, and a weakened dollar, while Trump’s short-term revenue gains may be offset by long-term economic isolation and reduced global market access."

The mission comes after a series of explosive failures that had cast doubt on the rocket’s reliability and its ambitious goals, including Elon Musk’s vision of colonizing Mars and NASA’s plans to use Starship for lunar missions. The successful launch is a critical milestone for SpaceX, demonstrating progress in its development of a fully reusable, heavy-lift rocket capable of carrying large payloads to deep space.",
