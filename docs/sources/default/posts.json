    "essence": "- Summary: Tesla’s proposed $1T compensation package for Elon Musk includes watered-down versions of his past promises, such as robotaxis, Optimus robots, and FSD subscriptions, with looser timelines and vague definitions. - Novelty: The package rehashes Musk’s broken pledges (e.g., 1M Optimus robots by 2035, 10M FSD subscriptions) but with extended deadlines and broader criteria, like counting customer-owned cars as \"robotaxis.\" - Evidence: Musk’s 2029 claim of 1M Optimus robots/year is now a 2035 goal for 1M total units.

    "essence": "- News summary: A 2025 study identifies pulsed biogenic methane as the primary driver of oceanic anoxia during the Mesozoic Era's Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE), challenging prior assumptions about volcanic or thermogenic methane sources. - Novelty: The research uses a global biogeochemical model to show that microbial methane pulses—each exceeding modern industrial carbon emissions—triggered rapid warming and deoxygenation, linking them directly to marine extinctions. - Evidence/caveats: The model quantifies methane releases (comparable to global oil/gas reserves) and links them to reduced sulfate and organic matter burial.",
    "reactions": [
      ") World Impact: The study reveals that pulsed biogenic methane releases during the T-OAE were far more potent than previously estimated, with each pulse exceeding modern industrial-era carbon emissions, highlighting the Earth system's sensitivity to rapid carbon feedbacks.",
