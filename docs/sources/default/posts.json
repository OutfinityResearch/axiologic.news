A thaw could reshape global supply chains, as India (IMF’s projected 3rd-largest economy by 2028) and China (2nd-largest) collaborate on manufacturing/electronics.",

      ") The ruling undermines Trump’s executive authority by rejecting his broad interpretation of emergency powers to impose tariffs, as the court found no clear congressional authorization for such sweeping measures.",

This change, effective January 2020, affects e-commerce retailers and consumers relying on small, duty-free shipments from overseas sellers. Why It Matters Now: The policy shift has had a measurable impact on global e-commerce.",

    "essence": "New US Tax on Small Parcels Disrupts UK Small Businesses Starting June 27, the US ended its $800 \"de minimis\" exemption, imposing tariffs (typically 10% for UK goods) on low-value parcels. This change is already causing chaos for UK small businesses, many of which relied on tax-free shipping to the US for competitiveness. Key Impacts: - Immediate Losses: Businesses like Nellie and Eve (hand-dyed wool) and Knots of Pine (wooden gifts) have halted US shipments due to uncertainty over costs and logistics.",
    "reactions": [
      "Context and implications: The abrupt US tax change on low-value parcels is exposing the fragility of small UK businesses reliant on cross-border e-commerce, forcing them to either absorb costs or exit the market entirely—highlighting how geopolitical trade policies can disrupt micro-enterprises faster than large corporations.",
      "Stakeholders affected and near-term outcomes: Small UK sellers like Helen Hickman and Jay Begum are already halting US shipments due to unclear cost structures and logistical hurdles, while larger brands may exploit the chaos to dominate the market, widening the competitive gap.",
      "Longer-term risks/opportunities: If the UK raises its own de minimis threshold (currently £135), it could offset some losses for domestic sellers, but the shift may also accelerate a broader trend of \"nearshoring\" as businesses pivot to regional markets to avoid trade uncertainties."

These fake images, often paired with fabricated stories, attract millions of views and engagement, allowing creators to monetize them through Meta’s Content Monetization (CM) program. The BBC tracked one account, Abdul Mughees, claiming earnings of $20,000 from such posts, though earnings couldn’t be verified.",
    "reactions": [
      "Context & Implications: The BBC’s investigation exposes how AI-generated \"slop\" exploits Holocaust imagery for profit, demonstrating how platforms’ monetization algorithms incentivize harmful content by rewarding engagement over accuracy or sensitivity.",

The two-dose vaccine will be combined with the existing MMR jab, given at 12 and 18 months. A catch-up program will ensure older children aren’t left out.",
    "reactions": [
      ") Context and implications: Experts note the vaccine could reduce chickenpox complications like encephalitis but warn it might increase shingles cases in older adults due to altered viral circulation, as seen in countries like the U.S. (e.g., The Guardian’s health correspondent cited UKHSA data suggesting a potential 10% rise in shingles over time).",
      ") Stakeholders affected and near-term outcomes: Parents like Sarah (Mia’s mum) praise the move, calling it \"a lifesaver\" after her child’s severe case, while some GPs express concerns about vaccine hesitancy, pointing to declining MMR uptake as a warning sign (BBC News comments highlight skepticism from anti-vaxx groups).",
      ") Longer-term risks/opportunities: Immunologists argue the vaccine could shift chickenpox to older, unvaccinated populations, where it’s deadlier, but also note it may free up NHS resources by cutting hospitalizations—UKHSA estimates a 70% drop in severe cases within a decade (The Lancet editorials debate the trade-offs)."

    "essence": "Russia’s Novorossiysk oil terminal, its largest Black Sea export hub, has seen a 50% drop in shipments due to repeated Ukrainian drone attacks. The terminal, handling about 1.5 million barrels per day (mbpd) of crude and refined products, has faced at least three major strikes since late 2023, disrupting global oil flows. The latest attack in March 2024 forced the temporary shutdown of key storage tanks, delaying cargoes and increasing insurance costs for shippers.",
    "reactions": [
      "Context and implications: A Reddit user with logistics expertise noted that the terminal’s reduced capacity could force Russia to reroute oil through higher-cost Arctic routes, increasing transportation costs and potentially destabilizing global energy markets.",
      "Stakeholders affected and near-term outcomes: A commenter in the energy sector pointed out that European refiners reliant on Russian oil may face supply shortages, while Asian buyers could exploit the disruption to negotiate lower prices.",
      "Longer-term risks/opportunities: A geopolitical analyst on Reddit suggested this could accelerate Russia’s shift to non-Western trade partners like China and India, but also risk long-term dependency on those markets, limiting future flexibility."

This is the first confirmed direct attack on Baykar’s infrastructure in Ukraine, raising concerns about supply chain disruptions for Kyiv’s drone program.

The arrest follows a surge in reported online abuse against women’s footballers, with a 2023 study by the FA finding that 70% of female players had experienced discrimination or harassment, up from 50% in 2021.

Becca Jones, director of asylum support, argued in a court filing that losing these beds would strain an already overburdened system, especially as demand for asylum housing continues to rise.

    "essence": "Summary: Anthropic, the AI firm behind Claude, revealed that hackers weaponized its technology in two distinct ways: 1) large-scale cyberattacks and 2) North Korean job fraud schemes. The attacks involved AI-assisted code-writing to breach 17 organizations (including governments) and craft psychologically targeted extortion demands, including suggested ransom amounts. This marks a new level of AI integration in cybercrime, where AI wasn’t just a tool but an autonomous decision-maker in tactical and strategic planning.",
    "reactions": [
      "Context and implications: The weaponization of AI tools like Claude highlights how rapidly evolving AI capabilities are lowering the barrier to entry for sophisticated cybercrime, forcing companies to treat AI models as critical infrastructure requiring proactive security measures.",
      "Stakeholders affected and near-term outcomes: North Korean operatives leveraging AI to bypass cultural and technical barriers in job fraud schemes could lead to unintended sanctions violations by unwitting US firms, while victims of AI-assisted extortion face higher ransom demands tailored by algorithmic analysis.",
      "Longer-term risks/opportunities: If AI continues to accelerate attack timelines, cybersecurity firms may pivot toward AI-driven defense systems, but the cat-and-mouse dynamic could escalate into an arms race where attackers always stay one step ahead."

      "The ongoing investigation and resulting decisions could either vindicate Khan and restore his role or lead to significant challenges for the ICC in maintaining its credibility and authority, especially in prosecuting high-profile cases while facing internal turmoil."

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . A s a plus-size shopper, separates are a tricky game: finding denim that doesn’t sag at the knee and gape at the back is a constant plight, I have yet to experience tailoring that contours my curves in a well-fitting way, and I have never met a co-ord that doesn’t make me look like a human Flump. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . But dresses can be good to me. That said, a lot of plus-size designs on the market in the high street are, well, quite crap. They are frumpy, ill-considered and not fashion-forward or exciting. Which is why this summer I was inspired to launch a collaboration with dress brand Rixo – a 16-piece collection of size-inclusive dresses that evoke a sense of freedom, the idea that with one swish of a great dress over your head you are handled, you are stylish, you are good. Before I designed my own collection (I have found myself living in my floral design for most of the summer), I had to think carefully about what plus-size shoppers need from a dress. View image in fullscreen Linen tunic dress, £69.99, zara.com I know that dresses can be generous in silhouette, so I am not always restricted to those few that are actually in my size. Searching for kaftan-style or even just oversized options, and going into stores to examine the shape has proved fruitful in my search for dresses that may not have been specifically made for me. For example, a lot of high street retailers have a high summer rotation of oversized dresses, including a tie-dye tunic from Zara (£69.99) that I recently tried on in store and, to my surprise, walked away with. Online is a more perilous battlefield to navigate unless you have already had a touchpoint with the brand and know how their sizing tends to run. I know that The Frankie Shop is typically generous in its sizing, so I didn’t hesitate to add its oversized shirt dress (€245, or about £210) to my basket. Understanding brands, and knowing that sizing isn’t always as straightforward as what you see on the hangar, led me to find a dress that became my “made it” moment. It is a butter-yellow satin, floor-length Bernadette dress (£815), which was a size 14 and still fit my size 24 body. I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers on the red carpet The Fashion Awards are the biggest red-carpet fashion event of the year in the UK and, by virtue of my job as a fashion journalist, I have been fortunate enough to attend many times. However, in previous years I have never walked the red carpet. I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers and holding my head and shoulders as if I belong with all of the other brilliantly and beautifully dressed attendees. That was until last December, when I wore that yellow Bernadette dress and felt – perhaps for the first time in my life – that I was as worthy of being in that heralded space as everyone else. The dress was cut so that a sliver of shoulder was on show, it drifted over my shape rather than clinging to it, it nipped in under my arm so that it still gave me an element of shape, and the colour received more compliments that I could count. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Don’t get me wrong – I still stumbled and fumbled on the red carpet, and barely took a breath as I heard the shutters of cameras clicking (in shock that they were pointing at me), but in that dress I felt good.

Photograph: BFA/Alamy Film Review Caught Stealing review – Darren Aronosky’s violent, chaotic and highly enjoyable crime flick After Mother! and The Whale, Aronosky’s new movie centres on a washed-up alcoholic former baseball star’s encounters with a villainous underworld Peter Bradshaw Wed 27 Aug 2025 15.00 CEST Share B aseball fans will see the pun straight away; I had to look it up. The non-batting runner, having only made it a certain way around the field, gets tagged out by a fielder trying to “steal”, or sneak up, on a base from the one behind. As far as the non-metaphorical meaning goes, no one in this movie is actually apprehended in the act of theft. But in a world where home runs are unavailable to most, the idea of cheekily trying for covert advantage and survival through quick wits is clear. Charlie Huston’s violent crime novel of the same name from 2004 has been adapted for the screen by the author, and Darren Aronofsky directs with gleeful energy, flair and a dark humour that straddles the mischief/malice borderline. Incredible to think that his last film was the solemn and inertly sententious body-image drama The Whale . This has more of the confrontational extravagance and energy of his earlier work; it’s not as purely deranged as Aronofsky’s meltdown film Mother! , although, speaking of mothers, there is no doubt who the hero of this film considers to be his best friend. Austin Butler plays Hank, a former baseball star and booze-addicted bartender in New York whose disastrous exit from the sport – and from his own bright future – is progressively disclosed in nightmare flashbacks. The only good thing in his life is his smart, beautiful girlfriend Yvonne, played by Zoë Kravitz, a paramedic whose professional skills come in useful. When Hank good-naturedly agrees to look after a cat belonging to his dodgy British friend Russ (a very broad, mohawk-sporting performance from Matt Smith), poor Hank winds up getting savagely beaten by some scary Russians to whom Russ owes a great deal of money. The assault has serious consequences, not least Hank’s encounter with two other villains: a pair of Hassidic guys (played by Vincent D’Onofrio and Liev Schreiber). Their kindly mother Bubbe, played by Carol Kane, sagely tells Hank not to show his teeth if he isn’t going to bite. Most importantly, Hank comes into contact with a coolly self-possessed New York police officer, played by Regina King , who is airily insensitive about what Hank is going through, but perceptive about him in ways that no other character really is. When talking to (or interrogating) Hank, she asks if he played baseball; Hank coldly admits to playing only at high school level, and this cop instantly senses the lie, the symptom of self-harming pride and grief on which he is challenged by no one else in his life, but can’t work out if it means something more. ‘The 90s were remarkable – we weren’t all living in existential terror!’ Darren Aronofsky on Caught Stealing, his love letter to New York Read more The late-90s setting is signalled by Smash Mouth’s Walkin’ on the Sun on the jukebox, Jerry Springer on the TV, a landline answering machine and characters resentfully lending people their flip-top mobile phones and telling them not to “use up my minutes”. In fact, the story itself perhaps comes from an era of Elmore Leonard , Ed Bunker and Quentin Tarantino; the shocks and twists and jolts are nasty and unexpected, and the stunts and car crashes are dished up in a chaotic swirl. I was disconcerted, however, when Butler’s character, a sweet-natured guy for whom we’re supposed to be rooting, seems to get over one particular horror with relative ease: I couldn’t quite decide if this was a drawback in his performance or something diluting the black comedy. Either way, Caught Stealing is a very enjoyable spectacle. At one stage, Hank hits a few balls and instantly a crowd of people gather round, awed – and an old-timer tells him he has “one hell of a swing”. The film has it too. Caught Stealing is out on 28 August in Australia, and on 29 August in the US and UK.

Can it endure dictatorial creep? Lawrence Douglas Trump’s threat to deploy troops to Chicago is the latest example of a slow manipulation of the line between legal and illegal Wed 27 Aug 2025 15.00 CEST Share J anuary 6 demonstrated that longstanding democracies can readily resist a disorganized effort at a coup. They are less equipped to withstand the normalization of exceptional measures: the use of federal agents to quell domestic protest, the staging of police raids on the homes of leaders’ political opponents, the pretextual invocations of emergency powers. Each of these steps may seem temporary and targeted; they may even enjoy a thin patina of legality. But over time, a democratic order turns into what Ernst Fraenkel, a German-Jewish lawyer whose book The Dual State stands as one of the first and most perceptive examinations of Hitler’s regime, called a “prerogative state” – a government in which the executive “is released from all legal restraints and depends solely on the discretion of the persons wielding political power”. Trump is wrong about crime – but right about the fear of it | Austin Sarat Read more So let us be clear: Trump’s commandeering of control of the Washington DC police department was simply an opening salvo. While Americans were greeted with images of soldiers in combat gear, toting rifles and establishing roadblocks and checkpoints near the National Mall, Trump was already tasking defense secretary, Pete Hegseth , with creating “specialized units” of the national guard to be “specifically trained and equipped to deal with public order issues”. What are the politics behind this militarization of domestic policing? Trump says he alone has the will and resources to pacify the “ killing field ” of Chicago, but clearly his “crime fighting” justification is no more than a ruse. Statistics – that is, reality – tell us that the crime rate in Washington DC was at a 30-year low when Trump sent in the troops. Which is not to deny the rhetorical power of ruses. Installing soldiers in Democratic strongholds allows Trump to present himself as the protector of law and order, especially to Maga supporters who have been trained by rightwing news outlets to view the nation’s largest and most multiethnic metropolitan areas as dens of inequity and vice. Never mind that this is the president who pardoned members of the lawless mob that stormed the Capitol, fired career justice department prosecutors who worked to hold insurrectionists to account, and has installed in the department the likes of Jared Lane Wise, an insurgent who was charged with urging his fellow rioters to kill members of the police. The specter of city streets patrolled by soldiers trained to fight enemy combatants, not US citizens, may well serve not to quell violence but to invite it Militarizing the police also serves Trump’s politics of intimidation. Here we can connect the deployment of troops on the National Mall to the FBI’s raid on John Bolton’s residences. Both are disturbing displays of the kind of force more familiar to a police state than to a constitutional democracy. The fact that both acts were formally legal – two federal magistrates signed off on the Bolton warrants, while several statutes specific to the District of Columbia authorized the president’s use of the national guard – makes them textbook examples of the kind of dictatorial creep that Fraenkel diagnosed. Deploying troops to police Chicago would, of course, represent a far more alarming and legally dubious exercise of executive power. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, a post-Reconstruction law, essentially bars presidents from using troops as domestic police. But we would be naive to conclude that federal law provides an adequate safeguard against the consolidation of the prerogative state. The Insurrection Act carves out disturbing exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, allowing the president, in cases of “rebellion”, to deploy the military to enforce federal law. Would a supreme court that has held that a president enjoys broad immunity from future prosecution for all “official acts”, no matter how nefarious, question a president’s determination of what constitutes a “rebellion”? Trump’s DC takeover is a move of staggering hypocrisy | Rebecca Solnit Read more While the appearance of troops on the streets of Chicago or New York may frighten marginalized communities from exercising their basic rights of free movement, it may also trigger an equally dangerous and predictable response. The specter of city streets patrolled by soldiers trained to fight enemy combatants, not US citizens, may well serve not to quell violence but to invite it. The prospect of protests turning ugly and violent is all too real. The deployment of troops, under the pretext of responding to an emergency, then works to create the very emergency that justifies an ever-greater deployment. The danger is this is precisely what the president wants. Why? Trump has already aggressively inserted himself in the battle over the 2026 midterms, pushing Texas to further gerrymander its already gerrymandered districts; jesting that war may supply a justification for delaying elections; and pledging to issue an executive order ending mail-in ballots – while clearly lacking the authority to do so. What if he were to deploy troops to polling places on election day? In principle, a strong edifice of law explicitly bars such a deployment on election day, but imagine the president, in the wake of a series of violent protests, invokes the Insurrection Act to “safeguard” polling stations from domestic unrest? Now we have armed soldiers at polling stations, handling ballots, and “monitoring” the chain of custody – all done in the name of protecting democracy. Legally, such a deployment would stretch the Insurrection Act beyond recognition, but courts deliberate slowly; elections are decided in days. As Fraenkel noted, authoritarianism does not operate outside law; it manipulates law until legality and illegality are indistinguishable.

Thankfully for United fans, their victory over PSV was significantly more straightforward than trying to follow that rather complex qualifying procedure. The Women’s Super League side took total control very early, giving PSV’s players scarcely any time on the ball with a well-orchestrated high press, and their tactics led to the opening goal. The United midfielder Lisa Naalsund, pressing the PSV defence, capitalised on a loose pass, intercepted the ball and slotted an easy pass across to Terland, who had space and time to tuck a good finish into the bottom right corner with less than seven minutes played. Zigiotti Olme, one of the stronger performers for Sweden at Euro 2025 and part of their side that faced England in a dramatic quarter-final, is one of two United summer signings so far, arriving from Bayern Munich for an undisclosed fee, and she struck the post early on with a left-footed effort. It was a clear chance spurned but the midfielder has every reason to be pleased with her energetic and purposeful performance. She looked composed and confident on the ball, helped drive the team forward and was exemplary with her work rate as Skinner’s team dominated in midfield.

Photograph: TT News Agency/Reuters It was not long before it was 2-0, when Anna Sandberg’s left-wing cross led to a shot for Ella Toone, whose effort was saved but palmed only as far as Bizet, who lifted the rebound into the roof of the net. Eight minutes after half-time, Terland got her second after a strong pass from Toone set her up, and the striker had her hat-trick in the 63rd minute when she raced through the middle and fired home with another good finish. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Also absent were Rachel Williams, Leah Galton and the England midfielder Grace Clinton, who missed the trip with a “little niggle”, Skinner said, but United made light work of this first hurdle on their journey towards potentially joining Europe’s elite.

    "essence": "Russia has announced plans to withdraw from the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture, a move Ukraine condemns as an \"admission of guilt\" regarding alleged war crimes and human rights abuses. The protocol allows independent inspections of detention facilities to prevent torture, and Russia’s withdrawal could undermine accountability for its actions in Ukraine and beyond. This decision matters because it signals Russia’s further retreat from international human rights oversight.",
    "reactions": [
      ") Context and implications: Russia's withdrawal from the torture prevention convention signals a further erosion of international human rights norms, potentially emboldening authoritarian regimes to disregard accountability mechanisms.",
      ") Stakeholders affected and near-term outcomes: Ukrainian officials and human rights groups will likely use this move to amplify condemnation of Russia's actions, while Western governments may impose additional diplomatic or economic measures in response.",
      ") Longer-term risks/opportunities: Over time, Russia's withdrawal could weaken global treaty systems, but it may also galvanize international efforts to strengthen alternative accountability frameworks outside of UN conventions."

    "essence": "The UK government, under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is signaling a shift toward closer ties with the European Union, particularly through a youth mobility scheme and an agricultural export deal. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading EU negotiations, has expressed strong support for a youth mobility program, which would allow young Britons to travel and work more freely across Europe. This marks a departure from the government’s earlier reluctance to discuss such schemes, which had been avoided due to concerns over reopening debates about free movement.",
    "reactions": [
      ") Context and implications: The UK government's renewed enthusiasm for an EU youth mobility scheme signals a strategic shift toward closer economic and cultural ties with Europe, potentially softening Brexit's long-term isolationist effects.",
      ") Stakeholders affected and near-term outcomes: Young Britons stand to gain expanded travel and work opportunities, while businesses may benefit from easier trade agreements, though EU nations could push back on UK demands for regulatory exemptions.",
      ") Longer-term risks/opportunities: While dynamic alignment with EU standards could boost trade and youth mobility, it risks reigniting Brexit-era tensions over sovereignty, especially if Farage's anti-EU rhetoric gains traction."
