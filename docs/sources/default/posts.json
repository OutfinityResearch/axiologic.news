    "reactions": [
      ") World Impact: This AI-powered labeling and moderation system could significantly reduce the manual workload for open-source maintainers by automating issue triage and spam detection, potentially accelerating project development cycles.",

      ") Practical Implication for Readers: Open-source maintainers should evaluate these actions to streamline workflows, but may need to fine-tune prompts to avoid false positives in moderation or overly generic labels in assessments."
