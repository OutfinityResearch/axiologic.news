Novelty/Claim to Fame: The discovery challenges previous mass estimates of J0529 and offers a potential explanation for the origin of supermassive black holes. Evidence/Uncertainty: New observations using powerful optical equipment at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, published on arXiv (DOI: 10.48550/arxiv.2509.13911), revealed the black hole's mass to be approximately one billion solar masses—ten times less than initially believed.",
