    "essence": "- News summary: Flathead catfish, introduced to the Susquehanna River in 1991, have become apex predators, forcing native species like smallmouth bass and channel catfish to shift diets and habitats to avoid competition or predation. - Novelty: The study quantifies how invasive flatheads disrupt food webs, broadening dietary overlaps and destabilizing energy flow in the river ecosystem, supporting the \"trophic disruption hypothesis.\" - Evidence: Stable isotope analysis of 279 fish and 64 crayfish revealed flatheads occupy the highest trophic position, while channel catfish in invaded areas now consume lower-trophic prey. The study, published in Ecology (Sept.",
    "reactions": [
      ") World Impact: The invasive flathead catfish’s dominance in the Susquehanna River demonstrates how a single apex predator can disrupt entire food webs, forcing native species into dietary and habitat shifts that destabilize ecosystems.",
