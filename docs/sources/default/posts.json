    "essence": "- News summary: Three films at the 50th Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) explore power, creation, and survival, using Orwellian themes, Gaza’s siege, and AI parallels to Frankenstein. - Novelty: Orwell: 2+2=5 (Raoul Peck) reinterprets Orwell’s warnings through modern authoritarianism and misinformation; Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk (Sepideh Farsi) documents Gaza’s siege via a Palestinian photographer killed in 2025; Frankenstein (Guillermo del Toro) reframes Shelley’s tale as an AI allegory. - Evidence: Peck’s film uses Orwell’s essays and Gaza footage; Farsi’s documentary features Fatma Hassouna (killed April 16, 2025); del Toro’s Frankenstein stars Oscar Isaac and Jacob Elordi.",
    "reactions": [
      ") World Impact: These films expose how authoritarianism, siege warfare, and unchecked technological creation mirror Orwellian dystopias, AI risks, and the human cost of indifference—urgent warnings amplified by real-world parallels like Gaza and AI development.",
      ") What could change next: If audiences heed these films’ critiques, public discourse might shift toward demanding accountability from governments and tech leaders, but history suggests complacency will persist until crises force reckoning.",
      ") Practical implication for readers: To resist manipulation, actively fact-check media, support independent journalism, and question the ethical limits of AI—before systems designed for control or profit outpace human oversight."
