    "essence": "- What’s new: Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres called on Australia to adopt a \"prosperity target\" of cutting emissions by 75% by 2035, framing it as an economic opportunity rather than a cost. - Why it matters: The push challenges Australia’s current 43% reduction pledge (by 2030) and could influence global climate talks, especially as a high-emissions nation. It also tests whether economic framing can accelerate policy action.",
    "reactions": [
      ") Stakeholders in Australia’s energy sector may face accelerated investment shifts as the 75% target could force earlier coal phase-outs than current policies allow.",
      ") A specific trigger could be the next federal election, where major parties may adopt this target to align with global climate pledges.",
      ") For readers, this sets a benchmark to assess whether Australia’s future policies (e.g., renewable subsidies) match the urgency of the proposed cuts."

    "essence": "The German chancellor’s statement that a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"obviously\" not happening is notable because it reflects a hardening stance in Western leadership on direct negotiations with Russia. While indirect talks have occurred, this direct dismissal of a Zelensky-Putin summit is a new and explicit rejection of bilateral diplomacy—a shift from earlier ambiguity about whether such a meeting could happen. This matters because it signals that Western-backed Ukraine is increasingly unwilling to engage in direct talks with Russia, even as the war drags on and battlefield stalemates persist.",
    "reactions": [
      "Context and implications: A German official’s dismissal of a Zelensky-Putin meeting suggests deep skepticism about diplomatic breakthroughs, signaling that Western powers may be preparing for prolonged conflict rather than seeking immediate negotiations.",

      "Longer-term risks/opportunities: If diplomacy remains stalled, NATO may accelerate arms deliveries to Ukraine, but prolonged war risks entrenching a frozen conflict, leaving Ukraine in a precarious geopolitical limbo."

    "essence": "A federal appeals court has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers—Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr., and Emmitt Martin III—who were initially acquitted in the 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols. The ruling, issued by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, overturned a lower court’s decision, citing errors in jury instructions and evidentiary rulings that may have unfairly influenced the outcome. Why it matters now: The case has reignited scrutiny over police accountability, particularly in high-profile use-of-force incidents.",
    "reactions": [
      "Context and implications: One user noted that the trial reversal highlights systemic issues in police accountability, as the initial dismissal was seen as a miscarriage of justice that only reignited public anger over police brutality.",

      "Longer-term risks/opportunities: A criminology professor observed that if the retrial results in convictions, it might set a precedent for stricter oversight of police misconduct, but if acquitted, it could embolden critics of reform efforts."

The attacks involved AI-assisted code-writing to breach 17 organizations (including governments) and craft psychologically targeted extortion demands, including suggested ransom amounts. This marks a new level of AI integration in cybercrime, where AI wasn’t just a tool but an autonomous decision-maker in tactical and strategic planning.",

Khan, who has denied any wrongdoing, is under investigation by a UN watchdog following allegations made by a member of his staff and a second woman, who was a former intern. The inquiry, which began last year, received the new accusations this summer, which date back to 2009 when the second woman was an unpaid intern working under Khan.",
    "reactions": [
      "The allegations against Karim Khan raise profound concerns about the integrity of leadership within the International Criminal Court, potentially undermining its mission to deliver justice and accountability on a global scale.",
      "Both the women who have come forward represent a broader issue of power dynamics in professional settings, particularly for interns and junior employees who may feel compelled to remain silent about misconduct due to fear of professional repercussions.",
      "The ongoing investigation and resulting decisions could either vindicate Khan and restore his role or lead to significant challenges for the ICC in maintaining its credibility and authority, especially in prosecuting high-profile cases while facing internal turmoil."

The defeat against League Two opposition marks a new low for the Premier League side under Amorim and any optimism evident prior to the new campaign is already dissipating. United, who trailed 2-0 after 30 minutes and could have found themselves three goals down in the second period, lacked any rhythm in an abject showing before Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire delivered late goals to take the tie to penalties.",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . A s a plus-size shopper, separates are a tricky game: finding denim that doesn’t sag at the knee and gape at the back is a constant plight, I have yet to experience tailoring that contours my curves in a well-fitting way, and I have never met a co-ord that doesn’t make me look like a human Flump. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . But dresses can be good to me. That said, a lot of plus-size designs on the market in the high street are, well, quite crap. They are frumpy, ill-considered and not fashion-forward or exciting. Which is why this summer I was inspired to launch a collaboration with dress brand Rixo – a 16-piece collection of size-inclusive dresses that evoke a sense of freedom, the idea that with one swish of a great dress over your head you are handled, you are stylish, you are good. Before I designed my own collection (I have found myself living in my floral design for most of the summer), I had to think carefully about what plus-size shoppers need from a dress. View image in fullscreen Linen tunic dress, £69.99, zara.com I know that dresses can be generous in silhouette, so I am not always restricted to those few that are actually in my size. Searching for kaftan-style or even just oversized options, and going into stores to examine the shape has proved fruitful in my search for dresses that may not have been specifically made for me. For example, a lot of high street retailers have a high summer rotation of oversized dresses, including a tie-dye tunic from Zara (£69.99) that I recently tried on in store and, to my surprise, walked away with. Online is a more perilous battlefield to navigate unless you have already had a touchpoint with the brand and know how their sizing tends to run. I know that The Frankie Shop is typically generous in its sizing, so I didn’t hesitate to add its oversized shirt dress (€245, or about £210) to my basket. Understanding brands, and knowing that sizing isn’t always as straightforward as what you see on the hangar, led me to find a dress that became my “made it” moment. It is a butter-yellow satin, floor-length Bernadette dress (£815), which was a size 14 and still fit my size 24 body. I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers on the red carpet The Fashion Awards are the biggest red-carpet fashion event of the year in the UK and, by virtue of my job as a fashion journalist, I have been fortunate enough to attend many times. However, in previous years I have never walked the red carpet. I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers and holding my head and shoulders as if I belong with all of the other brilliantly and beautifully dressed attendees. That was until last December, when I wore that yellow Bernadette dress and felt – perhaps for the first time in my life – that I was as worthy of being in that heralded space as everyone else. The dress was cut so that a sliver of shoulder was on show, it drifted over my shape rather than clinging to it, it nipped in under my arm so that it still gave me an element of shape, and the colour received more compliments that I could count. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Photograph: BFA/Alamy Film Review Caught Stealing review – Darren Aronosky’s violent, chaotic and highly enjoyable crime flick After Mother! and The Whale, Aronosky’s new movie centres on a washed-up alcoholic former baseball star’s encounters with a villainous underworld Peter Bradshaw Wed 27 Aug 2025 15.00 CEST Share B aseball fans will see the pun straight away; I had to look it up. The non-batting runner, having only made it a certain way around the field, gets tagged out by a fielder trying to “steal”, or sneak up, on a base from the one behind. As far as the non-metaphorical meaning goes, no one in this movie is actually apprehended in the act of theft. But in a world where home runs are unavailable to most, the idea of cheekily trying for covert advantage and survival through quick wits is clear. Charlie Huston’s violent crime novel of the same name from 2004 has been adapted for the screen by the author, and Darren Aronofsky directs with gleeful energy, flair and a dark humour that straddles the mischief/malice borderline. Incredible to think that his last film was the solemn and inertly sententious body-image drama The Whale . This has more of the confrontational extravagance and energy of his earlier work; it’s not as purely deranged as Aronofsky’s meltdown film Mother! , although, speaking of mothers, there is no doubt who the hero of this film considers to be his best friend. Austin Butler plays Hank, a former baseball star and booze-addicted bartender in New York whose disastrous exit from the sport – and from his own bright future – is progressively disclosed in nightmare flashbacks. The only good thing in his life is his smart, beautiful girlfriend Yvonne, played by Zoë Kravitz, a paramedic whose professional skills come in useful. When Hank good-naturedly agrees to look after a cat belonging to his dodgy British friend Russ (a very broad, mohawk-sporting performance from Matt Smith), poor Hank winds up getting savagely beaten by some scary Russians to whom Russ owes a great deal of money. The assault has serious consequences, not least Hank’s encounter with two other villains: a pair of Hassidic guys (played by Vincent D’Onofrio and Liev Schreiber). Their kindly mother Bubbe, played by Carol Kane, sagely tells Hank not to show his teeth if he isn’t going to bite. Most importantly, Hank comes into contact with a coolly self-possessed New York police officer, played by Regina King , who is airily insensitive about what Hank is going through, but perceptive about him in ways that no other character really is. When talking to (or interrogating) Hank, she asks if he played baseball; Hank coldly admits to playing only at high school level, and this cop instantly senses the lie, the symptom of self-harming pride and grief on which he is challenged by no one else in his life, but can’t work out if it means something more. ‘The 90s were remarkable – we weren’t all living in existential terror!’ Darren Aronofsky on Caught Stealing, his love letter to New York Read more The late-90s setting is signalled by Smash Mouth’s Walkin’ on the Sun on the jukebox, Jerry Springer on the TV, a landline answering machine and characters resentfully lending people their flip-top mobile phones and telling them not to “use up my minutes”. In fact, the story itself perhaps comes from an era of Elmore Leonard , Ed Bunker and Quentin Tarantino; the shocks and twists and jolts are nasty and unexpected, and the stunts and car crashes are dished up in a chaotic swirl. I was disconcerted, however, when Butler’s character, a sweet-natured guy for whom we’re supposed to be rooting, seems to get over one particular horror with relative ease: I couldn’t quite decide if this was a drawback in his performance or something diluting the black comedy. Either way, Caught Stealing is a very enjoyable spectacle. At one stage, Hank hits a few balls and instantly a crowd of people gather round, awed – and an old-timer tells him he has “one hell of a swing”. The film has it too. Caught Stealing is out on 28 August in Australia, and on 29 August in the US and UK.

Can it endure dictatorial creep? Lawrence Douglas Trump’s threat to deploy troops to Chicago is the latest example of a slow manipulation of the line between legal and illegal Wed 27 Aug 2025 15.00 CEST Share J anuary 6 demonstrated that longstanding democracies can readily resist a disorganized effort at a coup. They are less equipped to withstand the normalization of exceptional measures: the use of federal agents to quell domestic protest, the staging of police raids on the homes of leaders’ political opponents, the pretextual invocations of emergency powers. Each of these steps may seem temporary and targeted; they may even enjoy a thin patina of legality. But over time, a democratic order turns into what Ernst Fraenkel, a German-Jewish lawyer whose book The Dual State stands as one of the first and most perceptive examinations of Hitler’s regime, called a “prerogative state” – a government in which the executive “is released from all legal restraints and depends solely on the discretion of the persons wielding political power”. Trump is wrong about crime – but right about the fear of it | Austin Sarat Read more So let us be clear: Trump’s commandeering of control of the Washington DC police department was simply an opening salvo. While Americans were greeted with images of soldiers in combat gear, toting rifles and establishing roadblocks and checkpoints near the National Mall, Trump was already tasking defense secretary, Pete Hegseth , with creating “specialized units” of the national guard to be “specifically trained and equipped to deal with public order issues”. What are the politics behind this militarization of domestic policing? Trump says he alone has the will and resources to pacify the “ killing field ” of Chicago, but clearly his “crime fighting” justification is no more than a ruse. Statistics – that is, reality – tell us that the crime rate in Washington DC was at a 30-year low when Trump sent in the troops. Which is not to deny the rhetorical power of ruses. Installing soldiers in Democratic strongholds allows Trump to present himself as the protector of law and order, especially to Maga supporters who have been trained by rightwing news outlets to view the nation’s largest and most multiethnic metropolitan areas as dens of inequity and vice. Never mind that this is the president who pardoned members of the lawless mob that stormed the Capitol, fired career justice department prosecutors who worked to hold insurrectionists to account, and has installed in the department the likes of Jared Lane Wise, an insurgent who was charged with urging his fellow rioters to kill members of the police. The specter of city streets patrolled by soldiers trained to fight enemy combatants, not US citizens, may well serve not to quell violence but to invite it Militarizing the police also serves Trump’s politics of intimidation. Here we can connect the deployment of troops on the National Mall to the FBI’s raid on John Bolton’s residences. Both are disturbing displays of the kind of force more familiar to a police state than to a constitutional democracy. The fact that both acts were formally legal – two federal magistrates signed off on the Bolton warrants, while several statutes specific to the District of Columbia authorized the president’s use of the national guard – makes them textbook examples of the kind of dictatorial creep that Fraenkel diagnosed. Deploying troops to police Chicago would, of course, represent a far more alarming and legally dubious exercise of executive power. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, a post-Reconstruction law, essentially bars presidents from using troops as domestic police. But we would be naive to conclude that federal law provides an adequate safeguard against the consolidation of the prerogative state. The Insurrection Act carves out disturbing exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, allowing the president, in cases of “rebellion”, to deploy the military to enforce federal law. Would a supreme court that has held that a president enjoys broad immunity from future prosecution for all “official acts”, no matter how nefarious, question a president’s determination of what constitutes a “rebellion”? Trump’s DC takeover is a move of staggering hypocrisy | Rebecca Solnit Read more While the appearance of troops on the streets of Chicago or New York may frighten marginalized communities from exercising their basic rights of free movement, it may also trigger an equally dangerous and predictable response. The specter of city streets patrolled by soldiers trained to fight enemy combatants, not US citizens, may well serve not to quell violence but to invite it. The prospect of protests turning ugly and violent is all too real. The deployment of troops, under the pretext of responding to an emergency, then works to create the very emergency that justifies an ever-greater deployment. The danger is this is precisely what the president wants. Why? Trump has already aggressively inserted himself in the battle over the 2026 midterms, pushing Texas to further gerrymander its already gerrymandered districts; jesting that war may supply a justification for delaying elections; and pledging to issue an executive order ending mail-in ballots – while clearly lacking the authority to do so. What if he were to deploy troops to polling places on election day? In principle, a strong edifice of law explicitly bars such a deployment on election day, but imagine the president, in the wake of a series of violent protests, invokes the Insurrection Act to “safeguard” polling stations from domestic unrest? Now we have armed soldiers at polling stations, handling ballots, and “monitoring” the chain of custody – all done in the name of protecting democracy. Legally, such a deployment would stretch the Insurrection Act beyond recognition, but courts deliberate slowly; elections are decided in days. As Fraenkel noted, authoritarianism does not operate outside law; it manipulates law until legality and illegality are indistinguishable.

Terland’s classy treble, which was accompanied by a close-range finish from Celin Bizet, guaranteed Marc Skinner’s side some form of European football because their worst-case scenario would now be a place in the new second-tier Women’s Europa Cup. Their aim, however, is to join Arsenal and Chelsea in the Champions League and, on Wednesday’s evidence, they have a strong chance of doing so. New Spurs coach Ho hums right notes to boost WSL side’s confidence Read more United will face Hammarby of Sweden or Metalist 1925 Kharkiv of Ukraine on Saturday in a 6pm BST kick-off in the final of their mini-competition in this second round of qualifying. All four sides in this mini group are playing this week’s ties in Stockholm, at the 3Arena, with Hammarby the hosts. If United win on Saturday they would face a two-leg knockout tie in September for a place in the expanded league phase of the Champions League. Thankfully for United fans, their victory over PSV was significantly more straightforward than trying to follow that rather complex qualifying procedure. The Women’s Super League side took total control very early, giving PSV’s players scarcely any time on the ball with a well-orchestrated high press, and their tactics led to the opening goal. The United midfielder Lisa Naalsund, pressing the PSV defence, capitalised on a loose pass, intercepted the ball and slotted an easy pass across to Terland, who had space and time to tuck a good finish into the bottom right corner with less than seven minutes played. Zigiotti Olme, one of the stronger performers for Sweden at Euro 2025 and part of their side that faced England in a dramatic quarter-final, is one of two United summer signings so far, arriving from Bayern Munich for an undisclosed fee, and she struck the post early on with a left-footed effort. It was a clear chance spurned but the midfielder has every reason to be pleased with her energetic and purposeful performance. She looked composed and confident on the ball, helped drive the team forward and was exemplary with her work rate as Skinner’s team dominated in midfield. View image in fullscreen Celin Bizet (right) expresses delight after pouncing on the ball palmed out following Ella Toone’s effort to make it 2-0 to Manchester United. Photograph: TT News Agency/Reuters It was not long before it was 2-0, when Anna Sandberg’s left-wing cross led to a shot for Ella Toone, whose effort was saved but palmed only as far as Bizet, who lifted the rebound into the roof of the net. Eight minutes after half-time, Terland got her second after a strong pass from Toone set her up, and the striker had her hat-trick in the 63rd minute when she raced through the middle and fired home with another good finish. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "essence": "What difference will marriage make to Taylor Swift's music? 1 hour ago Share Save Mark Savage Music Correspondent Share Save Getty Images Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have announced their engagement after two years of dating Every fairytale needs a happy ending, and after 11 albums of love, heartbreak and shattered dreams, Taylor Swift has found her Prince Charming. But after she announced her engagement to Travis Kelce, what will Swift's newfound happiness mean for her music? Swift's greatest gift as a lyricist is the way she weaves her own story into her songs, balancing intricate, specific detail with universal themes of love, hope, heartbreak and betrayal. And from the very beginning, the musician's love life has been the connective tissue of her writing. Her debut single, Tim McGraw , written during a school maths class, was all about her then-boyfriend, Drew Dunlap. Believing they'd break up before he left for college (a premonition that came true), she wrote a song to commemorate the times they'd slow-danced in the moonlight to the car radio: \" When you think Tim McGraw/I hope you think of me. \" It's a timeless story - one that's destined to be repeated at fresher's weeks across the country this autumn - and set in motion a career-long narrative about Swift's romantic tribulations. She's written about emotionally unavailable men (Jake Gyllenhaal, All Too Well ), falling for a bad boy (Harry Styles, I Knew You Were Trouble ) and rebound romances (Tom Hiddleston, Getaway Car ). Throughout it all, she's been aware of the obsessive level of debate around her relationships. In Shake It Off , she poked fun at the media's discourse: \" I go on too many dates / But I can't make them stay / At least, that's what people say. \" Getty Images Swift's relatable lyrics have made her one of the biggest pop stars on the planet Blank Space went one step further, taking every horrible rumour about her love life and amplifying it with satirical relish. \"In the last couple of years the media have had a wonderful fixation on painting me as the psycho serial dater girl,\" she told the Grammy Museum . \"Every article was like, 'Here's Taylor Swift standing near some guy. WATCH OUT GUY!' \"My first reaction was to be like, 'That's a bummer. This isn't fun for me'. \"But my second reaction was, 'Hey, that's actually a really interesting character they're writing about: She jet-sets around the world collecting men - and she can get any of them, but she's so clingy that they leave and she cries in her marble bathtub surrounded by pearls'. \"I was like, 'I can use this'.\" It's a theme she returned to on last year's But Daddy I Love Him – where she likened the online critics of her relationship with The 1975's Matty Healy to a village full of pitchfork-wielding puritans. Confronting her audience, she scolded: \" I'll tell you something about my good name / It's mine alone to disgrace / I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing. \" 'Contentment is a creativity killer' Now, it's reductive to cast Swift's back catalogue (274 songs and counting) to a soap opera about her love life. She's written insightful and witty lyrics about the media (\" You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me \", Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me? ); about the joyous bonds of friendship (\" We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way \", 22 ) and even getting away with murder (\" I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene \", No Body No Crime ). But not for nothing has she been called \"pop's greatest diarist\" and \"the maestro of memory\". So what happens when she settles down? As her friend and collaborator Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine once pointed out: \"Contentment is a creativity killer.\" Taylor's engaged - what we learned Swift announces new album on boyfriend Kelce's podcast End of an Era: Taylor Swift wraps up record-breaking tour \"Marital bliss and domestic boredom tend to make less interesting rock songs than looking for love,\" agrees journalist and author Hadley Freeman, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. For proof, look no further than Bruce Springsteen. In 1991, he married his bandmate Patti Scialfa, disbanded the E Street Band and relocated to California. Springsteen celebrated his new-found serenity with two albums, Human Touch and Lucky Town - but they are regularly ranked as his worst. Getty Images Beyonce's career entered a new phase after she became a mother in 2011 Female artists have frequently used settling down as a source of inspiration. Madonna's Ray Of Light, written after the birth of her daughter Lourdes, eschewed her brash 1980s persona for a more spiritual, psychedelic sound. Amid stiff competition, it remains her best album, and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise. When Beyoncé revealed her baby bump on stage at the 2011 MTV Awards , columnists tripped over themselves to speculate what it might mean for her music. But her next album, 2013's Beyoncé, was a turning point – a disruptive, experimental, futuristic R&B album that set the template for the third act of her career. Swift has already proved she can write affecting, moving songs from a place of happiness. Her six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn generated songs like Delicate and Lover, which rank among her best work. She's already written two songs about Kelce, both of which appeared on last year's The Tortured Poets Department album. On So High School , she described how his chivalry restored her faith in men (\" Get my car door, isn't that sweet? \"), while The Alchemy rhapsodised about the moment he won the Super Bowl and ignored the trophy to \"come running over to me\". The star recently confirmed that her forthcoming 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, is \"more upbeat\" than the rest of the material on Tortured Poets Department – which was largely concerned with her split from Alwyn and a tumultuous relationship with Healy. Speaking on the New Heights podcast , she said Showgirl was recorded during the European leg of her record-breaking Eras Tour – placing it in the early stages of her relationship with Kelce. \"It just comes from, like, the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life... and so that effervescence has come through on this record,\" she said. Summing it up more succinctly, Kelce described the album as \"12 bangers\". Getty Images The couple have been cautious about revealing details of their relationship in public So, to return to the original question: Will Taylor's music reflect her newfound happiness? It would be weird if it didn't. But let's not forget that her last period of domestic bliss, during the relationship with Alwyn, also prompted a shift away from diary-entry lyrics. The pandemic-era albums Folklore and Evermore embraced fictional, fantastical storytelling, set against a backdrop of organic, acoustic soundscapes. They marked a turning point in Swift's cultural acclaim, rejuvenating her career after the uneven and poorly-received Lover album. If marriage prompts another shift, it could open up a whole new chapter in her career. \"There's a whole realm of other material when you're married or settled down,\" author Olivia Petter told Radio 4's Woman's Hour. \"So it's a different kind of fairytale, a different kind of fantasy, that she's stepping into now.\" Some fans have already pointed out that the star's lucky number is 13 – and her 13th album will be the first to address her marriage. For conspiracy-minded Swifties, it almost looks as though she's planned it all along.

    "essence": "Four ways to keep your energy bills down 1 hour ago Share Save Lucy Hooker Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images Keeping yourself warm by wearing thick clothes, using blankets and drinking hot drinks can help reduce heating bills Energy prices are going up again in October, by about £35 a year for a typical household. It is the cap on the price per unit of energy that is going up, so if you use a lot of gas and electricity, your annual bill could go up by more than that. So what can you do to keep a check on rising bills? 1. Consider switching to a fixed rate The energy regulator Ofgem is advising people to look at fixing - so that the price you are charged per unit of gas or electricity does not change every three months, although the total bill will still vary of course, depending on how much energy you use. There are fixed deals currently available that are around 15% cheaper than the variable rate that you will be paying if you have not fixed (the rate that is limited by the regulator's cap), according to Gary Caffell, from consumer website Money Saving Expert. When the cap goes up on 1 October, that difference rises to 17%, so switching to a fixed deal will definitely save you money over the next few months, he says. After that it is a bit harder to predict what the variable rate will be, but fixing could save the typical household £250 over the next year, Mr Caffell adds. Before you fix, Money Saving Expert advises you look at all the deals available, not just what your own supplier is offering. But consumer group Which? also recommends keeping an eye on any exit fees when picking a fixed deal. If variable prices fall below your fixed rate and you want to get out of it before the end of your agreement period, you may have to pay a hefty sum. If you are already on a fixed deal that is higher than the current price cap then check whether you face an exit fee, and whether it is worth paying it to save on your bill. Energy bills to rise by more than expected ahead of winter 2. Pay by direct debit Some customers pay their bill as it comes in each month because they do not want their supplier to estimate their usage in case they are overcharged. But if you have a smart meter or submit a meter reading regularly that will not be a problem, says Mr Caffell. And you will need to switch to direct debit if you want to take advantage of the fixed deals on offer. Customers on prepayment schemes - usually people on low incomes struggling to pay bills - used to pay a higher rate than others, but now they pay 3% less than the capped variable rate. There are also a range of pricing schemes offering cheaper off-peak electricity, which suit \"savvy\" people who are able to manage their use, for example if they are charging an electric car overnight. But note that peak time prices are likely to be higher on those schemes, says Mr Caffell. If you decide to stick with your variable rate, it might be worth putting a reminder in your calendar to submit a meter reading before the rate goes up on 1 October. Getty Images Changing habits when using household appliances can also help, for example reducing washing machine temperatures 3. Check what financial support you can get There are a range of ways people on low incomes can access support. This winter anyone on means-tested benefits will get £150 off their electricity bill. Your supplier will apply the discount automatically unless you are in Scotland, where you will need to contact your energy company to ask for the help. Some people will also be eligible for a Cold Weather Payment and most pensioners will receive the winter fuel payment this winter, after political pressure forced the government to u-turn on its plan to restrict it to the poorest pensioners. Beyond that, most energy suppliers offer hardship grants for people struggling to pay their bills and the government's Fuel Direct Scheme can help you repay energy debt. You can get more advice from Ofgem , Citizens Advice , or your own energy supplier. People on low incomes may also be eligible for grants to help with insulating their homes. The government has a scheme offering £7,500 for people switching to air or groundsource heatpumps. But if you are hunting round for grants do watch out for scams pretending to be official money-off schemes. Energy bills to rise by more than expected ahead of winter How to keep warm when budgets are squeezed Energy price cap: How much gas and electricity does a typical household use? 4. Take another look at your energy use Once the temperature outside starts to fall again, it is important to stay warm, especially for the very young, old, and those with health conditions or reduced mobility. But there are plenty of ways you can keep bills lower without letting the temperature in your home fall below the recommended 18C minimum. You may already have hung thicker curtains and blocked the drafts over the last couple of winters, but do not forget to switch off radiators in rooms you are not using and wrap up. Money Saving Expert advises to \"heat the human not the home\". Turning down the flow rate on a combi boiler can save you money as often the water is being heated higher than it needs to be. Batch cooking and using an air fryer or microwave rather than heating up the oven for a small item can save energy. Take shorter showers and wash clothes at 30C rather than 40C. Dry clothes outdoors if you can, rather than using a tumble dryer, or hang clothes indoors but ventilate well or use a dehumidifier to avoid damp. If you are thinking about moving home, or undertaking renovations, it is worth thinking through how to reduce bills. When it comes to white goods, look for energy-efficient appliances.

I’m Eromo Egbejule, the Guardian’s west Africa correspondent. This week, I spoke to Tems about her latest project: the Nigerian singer-songwriter and producer has been helping African women overcome many hurdles in the music industry. ‘The future of African music is female and connected’ View image in fullscreen Global giant … Tems at Lollapalooza Paris last month. Photograph: Kristy Sparow/Getty In February, the singer Tems won the second of her two Grammy awards for the single Love Me Jeje, a milestone that made her arguably the most successful Nigerian woman in music since Sade Adu. “Dear God, thank you so much for putting me on this stage,” Tems said, flanked by her mother and members of her team. It was yet another win for the rising talent since her breakthrough five years ago on the track Essence with fellow Nigerian superstar Wizkid. As a newcomer in Nigeria’s music industry, Tems, born Temilade Openiyi, faced many challenges. Unable to afford beats for her songs, only a handful of people believed in her vision in those early days. Today, the 30-year-old is a household name, collaborating with megastars such as Beyoncé and Drake. She has also performed at festivals and on stages that many of her peers still covet – the 2023 NBA All-Star Game half-time show, Coachella in 2024, and at this summer’s Fifa Club World Cup final. Succeeding as a musician in Africa remains a tough endeavour and only a few make it to stardom. On that slope to success are many barriers, including lack of funding and infrastructure, that are even further compounded for women who additionally face misogyny. “There are some people who I looked up to in the industry but, surprisingly, they also wanted sex,” the singer Yemi Alade said in an interview in 2016 . The Beninese-French singer Angélique Kidjo has also spoken of people discouraging her from playing the drums, with one person insisting “drums are not made for women to play”. Tems told the Guardian: “When I first started gaining a platform, it was incredibly empowering to have women I admired, like Rihanna, Adele and Beyoncé, connect with my music. Their recognition validated my journey and, in some cases, led to opportunities to collaborate. Now, I want to give other women that same platform.” This is why, in early August, Tems assembled 20 of her countrywomen in the industry to help them forge their own paths to success. Tackling imbalances View image in fullscreen Breaking barriers … participants of the Leading Vibe Initiative in Lagos. Photograph: Deeds Studio Tems’s initiative isn’t the only one tackling these imbalances head-on. The Lagos-based nonprofit Audio Girl Africa , which describes itself as a “pan-African sisterhood building the future”, holds workshops and mentors female artists, A&Rs, marketers, and other music business professionals. In Nairobi, the Santuri Electronic Music Academy , founded in 2021, has trained dozens of female producers and engineers. At the continental policy level, the African Union’s Afri’Talent cohort , launched in December in Ethiopia, supports women and youth in the arts, including music, as part of a drive to unlock $100bn for African creatives by 2030. Until now, no programme on this scale had been backed by an artist of Tems’s standing. The first edition of the singer’s Leading Vibe Initiative (LVI) was held in Lagos, Nigeria, this month to position African women as decision-makers and creators, not just performers or content add-ons. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Long Wave Free weekly newsletter Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At LVI, there were workshops and masterclasses on long-term strategy and creative autonomy from industry-renowned A&Rs and executives at the Africa divisions of Sony and Universal Music. Participants also got to use iZotope, audio software created for the programme, to boost their technical skills. “For many women, breaking through means having to work twice as hard to be taken seriously, while also shouldering expectations around how they should look, sound, or present themselves,” said Lola Ige, the head of marketing at Sony Music West Africa, who moderated a panel on image and team building. Pearl Ehanire, who attended the masterclasses and other sessions, said she came away not just with the right software but with renewed confidence and new collaborators. “One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced in my music journey is access, particularly to knowledge, mentorship, and the right gear … [Now] I feel so much more confident in my journey as a music producer,” Ehanire said. “I’ve also been able to connect with so many amazing female creatives in the industry … I’m unimaginably grateful for the experience.” Plans are under way to hold a second edition in Nairobi, Kenya in the coming weeks, and elsewhere around the world. And hopes are rising across the continent that the initiative becomes another catalyst for inclusivity in the creative sector. “The future of African music is female and connected,” the radio host and songwriter Klaire Onyeka, another participant, wrote on Instagram. “[I’m] excited to be part of such a purposeful community.” To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday, please subscribe here .

Isabelle Faust’s sensitive reading of the latter’s Violin Concerto was sleek and organic; the Sibelius well-paced and weighty Clive Paget Wed 27 Aug 2025 13.02 CEST Share A rvo Pärt has written much austerely beautiful music, but few works are as direct and affecting as his 1977 Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten. The Estonian composer, who celebrates his 90th birthday this year , had only just discovered the purity of Britten’s music when the latter died. Pärt’s six-minute tribute pits undulating string scales against the sombre toll of a single bell. It was a fitting opening to a wide-ranging concert in which the venerable Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra was put through its paces by Pärt’s Estonian compatriot Andris Nelsons. Emerging from the most poignant of pianissimos, crisscrossing lines rose and fell before the conductor’s clenched hands wrang the final drop of pathos out of the final chord. Isabelle Faust was the late replacement for Hilary Hahn in Dvořák’s Violin Concerto, and although she kept one eye on the music to be on the safe side, this was an impressively organic reading of this amiable intermingling of 19th-century Romanticism and tangy folk idioms. Sleek and silvery at the top, and with a fine line in fluid phrasing, she highlighted the music’s shadier woodland tones while bringing a lightness and lift to the sunnier episodes that pepper the rhapsodic opening movement. View image in fullscreen Put through its paces … Leipzig Gewandhaus play Sibelius’s Second at the Royal Albert Hall. Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBC Faust is disinclined to showboat. Instead, she discovered a poetic delicacy in the concerto’s flashier corners, with Nelsons and his Gewandhaus players her willing and sensitive partners. The central adagio was warmly spun, while in the finale – a spirited Czech furiant – her filigree fingerwork flickered like mercury over the orchestra’s earthier stomp. Nelsons was generally a surefooted guide to Sibelius’s Second Symphony, though occasionally the music betrayed its fragmentary nature. Well-paced, if a little too loud too soon, he teased out plenty of internal dramatics, ratcheting up the tension in the opening movement. In the ensuing andante, baleful bassoons over a darkly determined pizzicato tread powered the tempest-tossed music towards its implacable conclusion. The whirling scherzo was tense, bracing even, while the conductor’s deftly broadened tempi imbued the long-breathed finale with the necessary weight and nobility.

The 13-year-old had a curiosity for war memorabilia and the Nazi dictator, a fascination with weapons, and claimed to speak German and Russian. After she was found with a knife at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, a referral to the government’s anti-terror scheme was discussed but not pursued. The girl later armed herself with her father’s multi-tool and attacked teachers Fiona Elias and Liz Hopkin and a pupil in April last year. After her arrest she told police : “That’s one way to be a celebrity.” She said: “I’m pretty sure this is going to be on the news, so more eyes will be looking at me.” View image in fullscreen Teachers Fiona Elias, left, and Liz Hopkin were injured in the attack in the Carmarthenshire school. Photograph: Dyfed-Powys Police The girl was sentenced in April at Swansea crown court to 15 years detention after being found guilty of three charges of attempted murder. A multi-agency report was commissioned by Carmarthenshire county council and Mid and West Wales safeguarding board. The report examined the two years before the incident and found that although a lot of information was known about the girl – referred to as Child A – it had not been shared between agencies. Gladys Rhodes White, the report’s author, said: “Child A is seen as ‘quirky’ and ‘not quite fitting in’, having unusual interests in war memorabilia, Hitler, a fascination with weapons and purporting to speak German and Russian. “Her father describes her as loving to read, research things and having a fertile imagination, creating fantasies. “Following the first knife-possession incident, there were discussions regarding whether a referral to Prevent should be made due to concerns that Child A may have the potential to be radicalised. There is no evidence to suggest a referral was made. “Whilst Child A may not have met the criteria for Prevent, this triggered an action for an early help assessment to be offered to holistically understand Child A’s needs. This referral was made and the team contacted the father, who declined the assessment. “Had this assessment occurred, this may have been a pathway through which agencies could consider alternative help, or for monitoring and support to be provided.” The girl had taken a ball-bearing gun in her bag to a previous school. After moving to Ysgol Dyffryn Aman, she threatened to use a knife on another pupil and her father agreed to carry out daily bag checks. Later, she was suspended for several days after being found with a knife in her schoolbag. Teachers at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman said they had not known much about the girl and her history and what they did know had related to her “emotional and behavioural needs”. On the day of the attacks, pupils knew she had a knife with her but had not informed any teachers, the report said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines UK Free newsletter Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The report said: “He described occasions when he tried to get help for Child A in dealing with her emotional and behavioural issues and felt none of the services understood Child A and her needs. He feels it is only since her conviction that she has started to receive help.” In her conclusions, Rhodes White said: “Each agency had their own pieces of the jigsaw. In collating all the pieces of the jigsaw, there is a much clearer picture of the extent of concerns around Child A’s state of mind and her associated behaviours. “It is important to note that no information held by agencies identified a clear ability to foresee the shocking and unexpected events which occurred in April 2024.” She said there needed to be more effective information-sharing between agencies and also a focus on how children who did not meet the threshold for Prevent were supported. Rhodes White added: “This is particularly pertinent for children who may be transitioning from one school to another, or when parents do not accept non-statutory help.” In a joint statement, Carmarthenshire county council, the school, Dyfed-Powys police and Hywel Dda University health board said they would be addressing the report’s recommendations. They said: “We acknowledge the challenging and difficult circumstance faced by the victims and the whole community of Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in the aftermath of the incident. We would like to pay tribute to the pupils, teachers, staff and parents of Ysgol Dyffryn Aman. “The school’s strong sense of community and empathy has enabled students to return to their classrooms promptly and safely, with their wellbeing promoted at all times.” Explore more on these topics Wales Schools Prevent strategy Crime Knife crime news Share Reuse this content",

Daniel Levy’s got very big plans for this club and this team moving forward.” Ho, back in the WSL after two years in Norway with Brann, namechecks other senior Spurs personnel and sounds a further note of optimism. “When you’re all aligned strategically and you’re all going in the right direction I believe you can make things happen,” he says, having joined Spurs last month. Gaupset to Zigiotti: stars to watch in Women’s Champions League this week | Moving the Goalposts Read more In the 2023-24 season, Ho guided Brann through qualifying into their first Champions League group stage, where they finished second before being eliminated by the eventual champions, Barcelona, in the quarter-finals. That influential first head coach’s role had followed time as an assistant with Everton and Manchester United. “It was probably the right time to come back,” the 35-year-old says. “There’s an expansion to the WSL and so on and I’ve probably come into it at the right time. More importantly, I think this club has huge quality and huge potential that we’re not fulfilling. It’s my job to make sure we do. There’s a lot of quality within the squad that maybe has not been able to be shown as much as people would have liked. The playing style, I feel, will help that.” Ho says he inherited a team “low on confidence and maybe belief and motivation too”. A sixth-placed finish and run to the Women’s FA Cup final in the 2023-24 season was followed by a disappointing 11th-placed finish that resulted in the exit of the manager Robert Vilahamn. Vilahamn and Ho are very different characters, the softly spoken Swede contrasting with the animated, loud coach from Merseyside. View image in fullscreen Tottenham’s Toko Koga fends off Arsenal’s Alessia Russo during last Saturday’s pre-season friendly victory. Photograph: Unnati Naidu/SPP/Shutterstock Ho says: “The first thing I said to the players was about motivation: ‘You have such a wonderful job as a person. There’s a lot of people that would love to be in that privileged position; the least we can give is an energy, commitment and hard work on the pitch and the quality and skill set will follow from the coaching staff.’ “Importantly, I’ve got to make sure that they feel valued, respected and trusted, and I want to take the reins off a little bit, to show we can be brave and that we’re good enough to play a certain way.” Five weeks into the project things seem to be going in the right direction. You cannot take too much from a pre-season friendly, but a 4-3 win against the European champions Arsenal on Saturday points to an improved ruthlessness and has lifted spirits. “I learned where we’re at as a group and individually and then the steps we need to take,” says Ho. “It’s really nice to see what we’re working on in training and the aspects we’ve discussed in education in the analysis room come to fruition. I’m really impressed with how they’ve applied themselves and how they’ve embraced something totally different to what they’re used to.” What does his football look like? “I don’t want to sit back. I know you get pushed back, that’s different, I don’t want us to drop back. We’ll be front-footed, like we were against Arsenal in moments. I want to make sure that we’re consistently stepping forward and defending forward and, with the ball, being exciting, being brave and allowing individual players to show their individual qualities. I want us to be more expressive as a team so that we’re exciting in games and people want to watch us.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How many plans does he have? “A to Z,” he says, with a laugh. “The game is going to throw you so many different problems. In England now it’s more of a chess game and you have to be very tactically flexible. In the first half we established good structure but we weren’t using the structure properly so we readjusted that slightly in the second half and that gave us more control and more opportunities to play forward and be brave. You have to appreciate Arsenal, they are a super, super team and they’re gonna have possession and are going to make us surrender at times, and we did, but the important thing for me was the ruthless edge we had going forward.” View image in fullscreen Tottenham’s player’s enjoyed a welcome pick-me-up with a 4-3 victory over north London rivals Arsenal at Meadow Park.

Technically, a lodger is different to a tenant. A lodger is someone who rents a room in someone else’s home, usually sharing living spaces such as the kitchen and bathroom. By contrast, tenants generally rent the whole property. Unlike a tenant, a lodger does not have exclusive rights to any part of the property – meaning you, as the landlord, can access their room (however, you should respect their privacy). Matt Hutchinson, a director at the flatshare website SpareRoom, says tenants generally have more rights than lodgers because the law recognises that homeowners and landlords are distinct roles, and sharing a home “requires a different set of rules”. He adds: “Homeowners who rent out (always furnished) rooms to lodgers do so under a licence rather than a tenancy agreement, which sets out the conditions of their stay in your property. “For example, you’re only required to serve ‘reasonable’ notice if you want your lodger to move out. That’s usually the length of the rental payment period, so typically one month, but it can be shorter. There’s also no minimum term required by either party.” Live-in landlords can ask lodgers for a deposit. But unlike a residential landlord letting an entire property on an assured shorthold tenancy (AST), there is no obligation to protect the deposit using a deposit protection scheme. Who can take in one? Most homeowners can take in a lodger, but if you have a mortgage, it is best to speak to your lender first. Mark Harris, the chief executive of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, says: “Even those lenders who don’t have an issue with lodgers may have certain caveats, such as a cap on the number of lodgers. Principality [building society] will only allow one, while Nationwide and Santander will allow up to two lodgers. Some lenders will forbid lodgers altogether.” Bear in mind that if you let rooms to more than two people, your property may then be classed as a “house in multiple occupation” (HMO) by your local authority. There are extra safety requirements and standards for HMOs, and you will often need a licence. If your home is leasehold, check the lease to see whether you need the freeholder’s permission to sublet part of the property. Council tenants can also sublet a room to a lodger, assuming the local authority gives the go-ahead. Private tenants can take someone in, too, as long as they have their landlord’s permission. Find the right person SpareRoom is the go-to site for lodgers and flatmates. As well as advertising your room, check the “room wanted” ads and sign up for alerts, so you will be aware of anyone looking in your area. Other websites worth checking out include Roomies UK and Ideal Flatmate, while MondaytoFriday and GetDigs UK specialise in weekday lets. Use word of mouth, too: ask friends, family or colleagues whether they know someone looking for a room. There is social media too: local Facebook groups are a good place to start. View image in fullscreen SpareRoom is the go-to site for lodgers and flatmates, but there are also other websites worth checking. Photograph: M4OS Photos/Alamy Earn up to £7,500 tax-free The government’s “rent a room” scheme lets you earn up to £7,500 a year (£625 a month) tax-free from letting out furnished accommodation in your home. The threshold is halved to £3,750 if you share the income with someone else. Most live-in landlords include bills in the rent. To determine how much rent to charge, research local market rates for similar rooms and adjust based on your specific circumstances. Consider factors such as the size and condition of the room, shared living spaces and the location. The income limit covers everything you charge your lodger – so if you charge them for cleaning, meals or laundry, you will need to count these fees or costs too. You do not need to do anything unless you earn above the threshold – in which case you will need to pay income tax on the amount above £7,500. “The tax-free threshold hasn’t been increased since 2016 and is no longer representative of average room rents today,” says Hutchinson. “This means many people who rent out rooms earn more than the threshold. If they do, they must opt into the scheme and complete a tax return to claim their tax-free allowance.” Do your homework When choosing someone to share your home with, it is important to check you are compatible. A quick chat will help you decide if someone’s lifestyle and personality fit with yours. Ask about working hours (including whether they work from home), smoking, pets, regular guests, cleaning habits and expectations. If you are in England, once you have found a potential lodger, you need to do a “right to rent” check to make sure they are legally allowed to live in the country. You can be fined or sent to prison for failing to carry out this check. To do this, you should ask to see relevant documents . There is an online guide that can help with this process. You may also want to carry out credit checks and ask for references before signing an agreement. Make an agreement A “lodger agreement” – or “licence to occupy” – is used by live-in landlords to rent out a spare room in their home. This is a different type of contract to an AST, which is what you would use if you let the entire property to tenants. You can include various terms in the lodger agreement, such as about rules on overnight guests and noise, cleaning responsibilities and use of common areas. Having everything in writing at the beginning can avoid disputes later on. The agreement should also set out the rent amount, payment frequency, how it should be paid (for example, by standing order) and any notice period required. View image in fullscreen If you use the ‘rent a room’ scheme to earn tax-free income, you must provide a furnished room. Photograph: JulPo/Getty Images Consider your finances If you are claiming benefits and take in a lodger, you must inform the Department for Work and Pensions at your local jobcentre immediately. Taking in a lodger can affect your benefit entitlements, and failing to report this change can lead to overpayments, penalties or even prosecution for fraud. If you normally get the 25% single-person discount on your council tax, this will end when a lodger moves in. However, if the lodger is a full-time student, the discount may still apply. Tell your home insurer Make sure your tell your buildings and contents insurer about your lodger, as failing to do so can invalidate your policy. You may need a home insurance policy that includes cover for lodgers, or you may have to pay an extra premium on your current policy. Your insurer may also add exclusions to your cover – such as theft if there is no forced entry. You will need to check with your provider whether the policy will cover your lodger’s possessions, or if they need to take out their own contents policy. Set up the room If you use the “rent a room” scheme to earn tax-free income, you must provide your lodger with a furnished room. This means providing a bed and mattress, wardrobe or other storage, and a desk or table if there is space. You will also need to ensure the room meets fire safety standards, such as having working smoke alarms, fire-safe furnishings and proper ventilation. You will need to comply with gas safety regulations, too. This means your gas appliances must be checked every year by a Gas Safe registered engineer. On moving-in day It’s helpful to be around when your lodger moves in – do not just hand over the keys and disappear. They could have questions, so being available makes settling in smoother. Of course, you do not need to hover while they unpack, but make sure they know where to find you if they need anything.

The Grammy winner, known for his country-rap hit Old Town Road, was arrested on Thursday after police officers said he assaulted them after they found him walking the streets naked. He was taken to hospital for treatment for a possible overdose. On Monday, the 26-year-old rapper pleaded not guilty to injuring a police officer and resisting arrest. He was later released after paying a $75,000 (£56,000) bail. Posting on Instagram on Tuesday, he assured fans: \"Your girl is gonna be OK, y'all.\" He added: \"That was terrifying, that was a terrifying last four days.\" The performer, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, is facing three felony counts of battery with injury to a police officer and one felony count of resisting arrest. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison, according to the Los Angeles District Attorney. Police in LA said he charged at them when they responded to a call about a nude man on a busy main road. They said they believed he was using drugs at the time, and he must now attend an outpatient drug rehabilitation programme. 'Aberrant episode' The star's attorney Christy O'Connor said there was no evidence of drug use, however. \"This is just an aberrant episode in an otherwise productive life,\" she said, according to the Reuters news agency. His father, Robert Stafford, told reporters outside court that his son was \"very remorseful for what happened\". \"He's going to get the help that he needs,\" Mr Stafford added. \"Just keep him in your prayers.\" Lil Nas X rose to fame in 2018 with his debut single Old Town Road, which - with the help of a later remix featuring country star Billy Ray Cyrus - went on to become the longest-running number one song in US chart history, at 19 weeks. He came out as gay at the same time, going on to upend hip-hop with his LGBT-positive lyrics while also pioneering new ways of promoting his music online. UK music fans may recall him riding on to Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage on a giant fake horse while performing just ahead of Sir Elton John's farewell gig at the festival in 2023.

The total fertility rate across both nations, meaning the average number of live children women can expect to have across their child-bearing life, stood at 1.41 in 2024, down from 1.42 in 2023, the lowest since comparable data was first collected in 1938, according to the Office for National Statistics . This is despite a 0.6% increase in live births last year, with a 14% increase in babies born to fathers over 60, according to figures published last month. For a country’s population to remain stable over time – discounting any impact from migration – the total fertility rate needs to be about 2.1. Graph showing the changing fertility rate since 1938 The disparity is down to the fact the adult population increased in 2024, which outweighed the increase in births. Since 1938, an increase in births at the same time as a decrease in the fertility rate has only been observed six times, with four occurring since 2011. Greg Ceely, head of population health monitoring at the Office for National Statistics, said: “Fertility rates in England and Wales have been in overall decline since 2010. The total number of births increased last year, for the first time since 2021; but this was offset by population growth. As a result, fertility rates fell overall, and are now at the lowest rates on record.” The stats also showed that the long-term trend of the average age of parents rising steadily over the past 50 years is continuing: the average age of mothers and fathers both increased by 0.1 years in 2024, with mothers aged 31 and fathers 33.9, according to the ONS’ annual Births in England and Wales publication. Over the last two decades, the average age of mothers and fathers has increased by two years for mothers, and just under two years for fathers. Mothers living in London had the highest mean age across all English regions and Wales at 32.5 years in 2024, compared with the lowest in the north-east, at 30. In 2024, the average age of mothers in England and Wales having their first born (29.4) was noticeably lower than those having later-born children (31.8 for second, 32.9 for third, and 33.9 for fourth), suggesting that mothers tend to leave larger gaps between their first and second children than for subsequent children. When broken down by age group, the fertility rate for the age group 25 to 29 has decreased the most for both mothers and fathers, although there were falls for all under-30s. Conversely, it increased for mothers between 30 and 39, and for fathers it increased between 35 and 39 and decreased between 30 and 34. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two regions experienced an increase in the fertility rate, representing the first regional increases since 2021: the West Midlands increased from 1.56 in 2023 to 1.59 in 2024, and London increased from 1.33 in 2023 to 1.35 in 2024. The north-west experienced no change and all other regions recorded declines. Luton was the area with the highest fertility rate at 2, while the City of London’s was the lowest at 0.32. Politicians have been voicing concerns about the falling birthrate recently, in particular over the question of how a decreasing number of people of working age can support an ever-increasing number of pensioners. In July, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the falling birthrate had “worrying repercussions” and that she hoped to be able to make it easier for women to have children.

    "essence": "Vast private zoo run by son of India's richest man faces inquiry 2 hours ago Share Save Nikita Yadav BBC News, Delhi Share Save Narendra Modi/X Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Vantara in March this year Investigators in India will visit a vast private zoo owned by the billionaire Ambani family, after the Supreme Court ordered an inquiry into allegations that animals were acquired unlawfully and mistreated. The inquiry will also examine possible violations of wildlife laws at Vantara, as well as allegations of financial irregularities and money laundering. The Supreme Court said there was no proof to support the allegations but ordered an inquiry because authorities had been accused of failing in their duties. Vantara, run by Anant Ambani - son of Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani - is home to hundreds of elephants, tigers and other animals. It has promised full co-operation with the inquiry. \"Vantara remains committed to transparency, compassion and full compliance with the law. Our mission and focus continues to be the rescue, rehabilitation and care of animals,\" it said, without directly commenting on the allegations. Spread over 3,500 acres and home to some 2,000 species, Vantara bills itself as the world's largest wildlife rehabilitation centre. It was one of the venues for Anant Ambani's lavish pre-wedding events that made global headlines last year. The animal collection is located in Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, not far from Mukesh Ambani's oil refinery - the largest in the world. AFP via Getty Images Vantara came into the spotlight during one of the pre-wedding events of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant Vantara was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March this year, who called the effort \"truly commendable\", while sharing glimpses of his visit on X. But it is closed to the public and has long drawn criticism from wildlife activists and conservationists. The Supreme Court was ruling on public interest petitions which it said contained \"unsupported\" allegations. But it added: \"In the wake of the allegations that the statutory authorities or the courts are either unwilling or incapable of discharging their mandate... we consider it appropriate in the ends of justice to call for an independent factual appraisal.\" Vantara is home to a wide variety of animals - including about 200 elephants, 300 big cats such as leopards, tigers, and lions, and more than 300 herbivores and 1,200 reptiles, according to the News18 website, part of the Reliance conglomerate owned by the Ambani family. Photos of Indian film stars visiting the shelter made headlines in March last year, when they toured the facility as part of the pre-wedding celebrations of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant. The event was attended by celebrities, politicians and global business leaders. The shelter has been at the centre of angry protests in the state of Maharashtra recently, after an ailing elephant called Mahadevi, kept at a Jain temple in Kolhapur town for three decades, was relocated to Vantara in July, after a high court order. Following the criticism, Maharashtra's chief minister said the state government would file a review petition in the Supreme Court to bring Mahadevi back. Vantara/Instagram There are more than 2,000 animals in Vantara Activists have also claimed that Vantara's location in Gujarat state, with its hot and dry climate, as well as its location next to a giant oil refinery, was unsuitable for some of the species kept at the centre. During the hearing on Tuesday, the Supreme Court asked the four-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) panel of four retired judges to submit its report on Vantara by 12 September. The investigation, it said, would focus on claims of illegal animal acquisition - especially of elephants - as well as violations of wildlife laws, and allegations of financial irregularities and money laundering. The SIT will also look into complaints \"regarding climatic conditions\" and allegations of the facility being located near an industrial zone. Local media have reported that the SIT held its first meeting on Tuesday, which was focused on assigning roles and responsibilities to its members. The next court hearing is scheduled for 15 September. Follow BBC News India on Instagram , YouTube, Twitter and Facebook . Asia Wildlife India",

    "essence": "Conservative MSP Graham Simpson defects to Reform 10 minutes ago Share Save Craig Williams BBC Scotland News Share Save Simpson says he has joined Reform to help get the SNP out of office Conservative MSP Graham Simpson has defected to Reform. Simpson announced his move as he appeared at a press conference in Scotland with Reform leader Nigel Farage. The new Reform MSP told journalists that many would not be surprised to see him defect, and that leaving the Conservatives was \"an enormous wrench\". He is the second MSP to leave the party's Holyrood group in the past week. The move means Simpson becomes Reform's sole current MSP. Michelle Ballantyne sat as a Reform member at the Scottish Parliament from January to May 2021, having left the Conservatives the previous year and sitting for a short spell as an independent. She lost her seat at the May 2021 election. PA Media Nigel Farage announced the defection of Graham Simpson in Broxburn Simpson has been an MSP for the Central Scotland region since 2016. He is a former journalist with The Sun and Daily Record. He said he would not step down from the Central Scotland regional list following his defection. Speaking at a press conference in Broxburn, West Lothian, he said: \"It's fair to say that some of you won't be surprised to see me here, given that the Scottish Tories have been touting my name as a potential defector for months now. \"So today, I'm giving them what they want, but perhaps not for the reasons that they think. \"Leaving the party that I first joined when I was 15 is an enormous wrench, and I've been through a lot of soul searching in the past few weeks.\" How achievable is Reform's plan on migration? How Reform has changed the debate on migration Simpson said he decided to join Reform UK to \"create something new, exciting and lasting\". Speaking with leader Nigel Farage by his side, he added: \"I've joined Reform because we have the chance to create something new, exciting and lasting that puts the needs of people over the system, that asks what is going wrong and how we can fix it.\" He said he thought Reform could \"help\" to remove the SNP from office after 19 years in power. Reuters Migrants board dinghies and small boats off the coast of France before attempting to cross the English Channel Farage's visit comes against a backdrop of increased tension and rhetoric around the immigration. On Tuesday, the Reform leader launched a scheme called Operation Restoring Justice, aimed at tackling the migrant issue. He said Reform would deport 600,000 migrants over five years if it won power at the next election. Farage said his party would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, under plans announced earlier. It says it would make £2bn available to offer payments or aid to countries like Afghanistan to take back migrants, with sanctions potentially imposed on uncooperative countries. His comments came after a poll, by the David Hume Institute and Diffley Partnership, suggested 21% of Scots think immigration is one of the top three issues in the country, up from 16% in May and just 4% in May 2023. It means immigration is now seen as the third biggest priority for the country, with only health and the cost-of-living crisis regarded as more important by voters. SNP slam Reform policies Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme a few hours ahead of Farage's visit, MP Stephen Gethins attacked the Reform MP for his \"extraordinarily damaging\" policies and rhetoric on immigration. Gethins, who is the SNP foreign affairs spokesman at Westminster, questioned Reform plans to work with the Taliban to send people back to Afghanistan, as well as having the UK leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). He said Brexit - which Farage campaigned for - had \"pushed up the small boats crisis\" in the UK. \"He is the architect, along with people like Boris Johnson and others, of the small boats crisis,\" he said. \"Now he wants to remove us from the European Convention on Human Rights, which was the convention introduced at the end of the Second World War to give us some of the most basic rights, like prohibition of torture and right to life and all these other basic things we take for granted.\" Gethins said these policies show Farage \"is an extraordinarily damaging politician\". \"I think most people can see that doing a deal with the Taliban to send back women, human rights advocates and others who have campaigned against that brutal regime is unrealistic,\" he added. \"I don't think it is realistic, and I think any basic reading of this is unrealistic. \"That is why Nigel Farage is one of the most disastrous politicians. He is one of the most consequential, but not in a good way.\" It felt like it was only a matter of time until a Conservative MSP jumped ship to Reform. With a Holyrood election next year, the Tory position looks bleak. Reform UK seems to be on the up. Graham Simpson's name was one that was doing the rounds as a likely defector. The Conservatives seem to be leaking MSPs fast. Will he be the last to depart? Simpson seems to see this as an opportunity to help shape something new. It may also be a route to make his re-election to Holyrood next year more likely. Graham Simpson is a big campaigner for recall - the right to essentially fire your MSP under certain circumstances. Ironically, there will be plenty who think that switching parties should be grounds for that. But Simpson insists it's right that he stays put on the Holyrood benches.

The London club are also looking to move Yves Bissouma to Galatasaray. The 28-year-old, who is out of contract next summer, has dropped to the bottom of the central midfield pecking order, having frustrated Thomas Frank with his timekeeping . Vuskovic joined Spurs this summer, albeit his move from Hajduk Split was agreed in September 2023, and announced his arrival with a goal and an assist in the pre-season win at Reading . The 18-year-old centre-half played in the next friendly against Wycombe before his minutes dried up; he has been an unused substitute since the season began. Hamburg, who won promotion back into the Bundesliga last season, have monitored Vuskovic throughout the summer and can see he is behind Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven and Kevin Danso in Frank’s thinking. The head coach also has Radu Dragusin, who is fighting back from an anterior cruciate ligament rupture sustained in late January, and the new signing Kota Takai as options at centre-half, not to mention Ben Davies. Takai has not yet featured as he has battled a heel injury. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mia Keevan, 17, from County Tipperary in the Republic of Ireland, took unwell at the event and died shortly afterwards in hospital. In a separate incident 24-year-old Trae Keenan, from County Down, died in rented accommodation in the city centre a few hours after the event ended. Shine productions, which organised the festival, has been approached for comment. Emerge music festival is the biggest dance music event in Northern Ireland. It usually takes places over the August bank holiday weekend at Boucher Playing Fields in south Belfast and attracts crowds of about 40,000 dance music fans each day. This year the festival was headlined by Fatboy Slim on Saturday and Bicep on Sunday, while Sammy Virji, Fjaak, Sonny Fodera and Danny Howard were also on the line up. Pacemaker Around 80,000 people attended the Emerge festival over the weekend Mia was visiting Belfast from Carrick-on-Suir to attend the event. Investigations are still continuing into what caused her death. Belfast district commander Supt Allister Hagan said: \"During the event it was reported that a 17-year-old girl had become unwell. Sadly, she subsequently died in hospital.\" \"Police remained on the event site until Monday afternoon, 25 August. \"An investigation in order to establish the circumstances surrounding the tragic sudden death of this young person is ongoing, and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the deceased.\" Sarah Roche, who is raising money for Mia's family, posted on an online fundraising page to say the teenager was a \"bright, fun and much loved girl who touched the hearts of anyone that knew her\". \"Mia was such an outgoing person and lit up every room she walked into,\" she said. \"Her laughter and warmth will never be forgotten by those lucky enough to have known her.\" Belfast City Council, which operates Boucher Playing Fields, said it \"was deeply saddened by the death\" and added that it sent \"sincere condolences to the young person's family at this difficult time\". pacemaker The annual event is held at Boucher Playing Fields in south Belfast Mr Keenan also attended the festival and took unwell and died after he returned to his rented accommodation in Belfast. He worked as a chef and had a four-month-old son. In a funeral notice he was described as a \"dearly beloved son of Pamela and John and cherished father of Mason, loving brother of Shanice, Tyler, Claire and Toni and loving partner of Tiffany\". Speaking to the Irish News, Shanice said the family was devastated following his death. \"Trae was someone that would do anything for anyone,\" she said. \"He was very funny, very strong-hearted. He had the biggest smile you could ever see. He had so much stride in his walk. \"The whole town just loved him; everyone adored him. \"It still doesn't feel real. It's horrible. \"From his videos and stuff, he had the best night, he really did. But it is terrible how it ended.\" The Irish News reported Mr Keenan had previously suffered from heart complications and asthma. The family told the newspaper he had suffered a panic attack and his death was not linked to drugs. Pacemaker Acts like Fatboy Slim and Bicep were headlining the event over the weekend Police are still investigating both deaths and said a number of arrests were made over the weekend. Supt Hagan said several organisations - including the Police Service of Northern Ireland and Belfast City Council were involved with making sure the festival passed off safely. He said officers made seven arrests over the weekend and issued three fixed penalty notices, one caution and nine community resolution notices. He said offences included disorderly behaviour, drink-driving, assault on police and possession of controlled drugs. City councillors have called for an emergency meeting with the event organisers.

The suspect, in his 40s, was detained on Tuesday two days after Small’s body was discovered outside his home on Slievenabrock Avenue in Newcastle, County Down. Police said the victim was last seen alive on 19 August and at some point between then and 24 August he had sustained a “brutal and sustained attack”. In 2022, Small pleaded guilty to 10 sexual offences against a woman described as “vulnerable” and a teenage girl. He was sentenced to three years in prison and three years under supervision in the community, and had recently returned home. Police said they had an open mind about the motive for the incident and asked the public to not speculate. A postmortem is under way to establish the time and manner of death. “I know the local community will be in shock following the news of this crime,” Det Ch Insp Kerrie Foreman told reporters on Tuesday. “Detectives are working as quickly as possible to understand how and why this has taken place.” She confirmed there had been an incident of criminal damage at Small’s house several weeks ago. He lived on a quiet, residential street in the seaside town. Crimestoppers have offered a reward of up to £20,000 for information that leads to arrest and conviction of those responsible for the murder. The mother of one of Small’s victims told the Belfast Telegraph that neither she nor her daughter had been notified of his release but there had been a rumour in recent weeks that he was out of prison.

The Guardian has learned that ministers are planning to halve the period asylum seekers are given to find new accommodation after getting a decision on their case, from 56 to 28 days. Refugee organisations say this is not enough time to find work and a home to rent and will lead to many people pitching tents in the streets. The British Red Cross is among those raising concerns about an increase in rough sleeping among refugees and, along with other refugee NGOs, is calling on the government to rethink. Alex Fraser, the British Red Cross director of refugee services, said: “Reducing the ‘move-on’ period will increase levels of homelessness and destitution for people granted protection and put additional pressure on local authorities. “The numbers don’t add up. It takes around 35 days to receive universal credit. Local authorities need 56 days to work with households at risk of homelessness. Giving people only 28 days to find work, housing or support isn’t enough time. “Making people destitute ends up costing the taxpayer more money and causing distress and hardship. We urge the government to review this decision.” The government is grappling with a crisis over the use of hotels for asylum seekers, with dozens of protests staged by anti-migrant groups and individuals in recent weeks. Ministers are under pressure to expedite hotel closures and have committed to speeding up asylum decision-making, a decision welcomed by refugee organisations and by asylum seekers. But if there is not sufficient time for refugees to find work and accommodation, this could increase street homelessness. Government data for the year ending June 2025 showed that 110,000 people received a decision on their asylum claim, with about half granted leave to remain. According to the No Accommodation Network (Naccom), which has 140 charity and community group members supporting people facing homelessness in the asylum and immigration system, in 2023-24 homelessness among refugee adults increased by 99%, with a sharp rise in rough sleeping of 125%, in particular among new refugees as a result of not enough time to move on. In response to these concerns, the Home Office introduced a 56-day move-on pilot scheme in December 2024, which markedly decreased street homelessness among this group. One Red Cross source said that since the 56-day policy was introduced they could not recall the last time a refugee had asked them for a tent. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is understood exceptions to the rule will include pregnant women, families and elderly people, who will still have 56 days. Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais said: “Cutting the move-on period back to 28 days isn’t just bad for newly granted refugees, it’s bad for our communities and extremely bad for councils, who are picking up the tab of increasing homelessness.” Bridget Young, director of Naccom, said: “We are hugely disappointed by ministers’ decision to revert back to the 28-day notice period for refugees with the fewest options available to them and therefore at most risk of homelessness and destitution. Evidence from Naccom’s frontline members indicates that the 56-day move-on period has been a lifeline for new refugees. “This decision will put more pressure on local authorities and voluntary sector services, who always have to pick up the pieces to kneejerk government policy change. This change is also being made at a time of increasing risk due to racism and anti-migrant rhetoric, which we worry will only increase the danger people will face on the streets. We urgently ask government to reconsider this decision.” Explore more on these topics Immigration and asylum Refugees Homelessness Housing news Share Reuse this content",

    "essence": "09.19 CEST Conservatives could 'potentially' strike a deal with Taliban-run Afghanistan to return migrants, says party chair The Conservatives could “potentially” strike a deal with Afghanistan over migration, the party’s chair has said. Asked directly if the Tories would set up a returns agreement with the Taliban -run country, Kevin Hollinrake told Times Radio: “Well, potentially, yes.” The former minister added that his party’s deportation plan, which was published in May, is “far more comprehensive than the one we’ve seen from Reform, in that it dealt with both legal migration and illegal migration”. The Conservatives could “potentially” strike a deal with Afghanistan over migration, the party’s chair Kevin Hollinrake has said. Photograph: Lucy North/PA Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch had refused to say whether she would consider seeking such an agreement when pressed on the issue on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage has been accused of “ugly” and “destructive” rhetoric after announcing plans to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and pledging to pay despotic regimes such as the Taliban to take them back. Unveiling Reform UK ’s “Operation Restoring Justice” at a combative press conference in Oxford , Farage said he would rip up the UK’s postwar human rights commitments, contained in a range of international conventions, to deport “absolutely anyone” – including women and children – arriving by small boat. Elsewhere, the Government has said it wants to get a permanent deal with the EU on food and drink agreed in the next 18 months, as it sets out its stall ahead of talks later this year. Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds and Conservative party chair Kevin Hollinrake are on today’s morning media round. I’ll bring you any interesting lines from them as they come in. But first, here are some other developments: UK companies spent up to £65m last year on licences to export food and agricultural products to the EU – costs that the government is promising to eliminate as part of a new deal to be agreed by 2027. Government figures released on Tuesday showed it issued 328,727 such licences last year, at a cost of between £113 and £200 each. That would put the total cost to business at somewhere between £37m and £65m. The cost of UK government borrowing has jumped to near a 27-year high, piling pressure on Rachel Reeves to reveal how she will tackle the deficit in the public finances before the autumn budget. The yield, or interest rate, on the UK’s 30-year bond rose by eight basis points (0.08 of a percentage point) on Tuesday to 5.62%. Ministers have approved plans to help a further 30 students leave Gaza to take up places at UK universities next month but their evacuation remains uncertain and dependent on Israel’s approval. It takes the total to 39, after a government commitment last week to work to secure the evacuation from Gaza of nine Chevening scholars with places at some of the UK’s leading universities. Energy costs will rise for millions of British households this autumn after the price cap for a typical annual dual-fuel bill increased by 2% to £1,755. The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem , will raise the cap on gas and electricity charges from October by the equivalent of just over £35 a year for the average home, following a rise in European gas prices.

    "essence": "How achievable is Reform's plan on migration? 21 minutes ago Share Save Dominic Casciani Home and Legal Correspondent • @BBCDomC Share Save Getty Images Reform UK leader Nigel Farage (R) and chair Zia Yusuf following the party's new policy Nigel Farage has set out how a Reform government would tackle what he called \"uncontrolled illegal migration\" – with moves including human rights law changes, and mass deportations. But how deliverable are the plans? Let's start with the headline figure of how many people the party badges as illegal migrants (the precise definition of this is up for debate) that it says it will deport. There's no figure in the party's document - but during the event Nigel Farage asked Reform UK chair Zia Yusuf whether it was realistic to deport 500,000-600,000 people within the lifetime of the first Parliament under a Reform UK government, to which he replied \"totally, yeah\". The party is proposing to create secure facilities to hold 24,000 to be deported every month - that gives us another figure of 288,000 a year, ramping up after 18 months of building work. Removing 6,000 people per week would, using today's operations as a guide, require an average of 1.7 escorting officers per individual removed. When you break that down into departing planes per day, that's within the maths for the party's projection of five flights per day. But these targets are far in excess of what any government has ever achieved. An average of 158 people per flight, plus security, would require the equivalent of five jumbo jets to be available all year around. That per flight number of 158 is three times higher that the numbers currently removed on the most-packed departures. One problem is nobody knows how many people are in the UK without permission or where they are. Evidence shows many of them are in vulnerable situations, including in what amounts to modern day slavery. Reform thinks it can find them with \"cutting edge data fusion\" and says it would give the state access to a vast range of personal information that it currently cannot obtain without a good reason. Any \"police encounter\" would involve \"mandatory biometric capture\", the party document says, far beyond anything that officers can currently do without first arresting you. Reform hopes this information will more quickly identify candidates for removal - but the wide scope of the plan could conflict with the UK's tough data protection and privacy laws. There is also a warning from history, with the government paying out more than £105m in compensation to thousands of people and their families who were caught up in the Windrush scandal . What would such a scheme cost? No government has ever tried to build prison-like detention facilities for 24,000 people in 18 months - the time scales envisaged by Reform - or at the cost claimed. For detention facilities to be escape-proof, they have to be the equivalent of what's known as a \"Category B\" prison - which means there are walls and locked doors, wings and gates everywhere with a suitable level of staffing. Official figures from the current prison programme show that it costs about £500,000 per bed to build such such \"closed\" facilities - and that's broadly the design standard used for immigration removal centres too. That means that if the party in government were to build 24,000 new detention spaces to that standard, it would cost about £12bn. Reform says it will build them for less by creating \"modular accommodation\" in remote parts of the UK. There are three immediate questions. First, would a modular plan meet the security standards? Second, where would they be built? Thirdly, how would they deal with local planning concerns which have repeatedly massively delayed prison building schemes in the UK? New laws could make scheme possible Boris Johnson's government promised 20,000 new prison spaces - but over five years only opened one new prison - partly because of planning disputes. The plan involves creating new laws to fast-track people into detention and removal from the UK - and providing the legislation is correctly worded, there is nothing in principle to say that Parliament could not create such a scheme. But it has been tried before and failed. In 2010 and then in 2015 judges ruled that accelerating failed asylum seekers through to removal was unlawful. The courts found in 2015 that fast-tracking conflicted with one of the UK's basic legal principles: the opportunity to fairly put your case before a court rules against you. So the challenge for Reform is how they deal with the fact that everyone has a right to be heard. One approach would be to say that it does not apply to immigration cases. That would inevitably faced sustained challenge on constitutional principles all the way up to the Supreme Court. Who knows if a carefully worded new law could see that off. But the fact is that good law takes time to write - and Reform would also have to unpick a lot of other laws too. That takes Parliamentary time to get right. Labour's current plan to \"smash the gangs\" by creating new counter-terrorism style powers to target people smugglers can't be said to be working or not yet because it is still being debated by Parliament. Assuming Reform's plan is bigger than that, experience shows that new laws of this magnitude can take at least a year to become a reality. A new government could, with a mandate and healthy majority, try to push it through faster - but policy advisers in Whitehall would warn ministers that rushing the job means a bad job that could later become unworkable. Reform prepared to deport 600,000 under migration plans How Reform has changed the debate on migration Farage vows mass deportations to tackle small boats Pulling out of the ECHR? Part of Reform's argument that it will do more because it will pull out of three treaties including the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the UN Convention Against Torture. A Reform government could indeed do so - although it would lead to some thorny legal problems if a lots of other laws linked to both were not unpicked at the same time. But it's not clear whether such moves would really do as much as Farage suggested. The ECHR is not, for instance, a bar on removing someone from the UK - and there is appetite among some European governments to tinker with it. As for the UN convention on torture, that kind of abuse has been outlawed in the UK, by our own laws, since 1640. If the UK pulled out of treaties, the risk is that our government loses international influence that it has built up over decades. There are two specific consequences of leaving the ECHR. Doing so would breach clearly written guarantees in Northern Ireland's 1998 Good Friday agreement which have been the bedrock of peace and prosperity there since in 1998. A Reform government could argue that its proposed Bill of Rights would do the same job - but that would be a tough sell to NI's nationalist community and to Dublin, the co-sponsor and guarantor of the political settlement that largely ended the violence. Separately, there is the question of trade and co-operation with all our nearest neighbours in the EU. The Brexit deal signed by the UK and EU member states says both remain under an \"obligation to respect fundamental rights and legal principles as reflected, in particular, in the European Convention on Human Rights\". How would the EU react? Would there be an economic consequence, even if that had not been the intention? Incentives to leave One of the side-ideas in the plan is to pay people up to £2,500 to leave the UK voluntarily. This is not new and the current scheme saves the government huge sums because paying people to go is cheaper than using the courts. Reform's offer is less than the £3,000 currently on offer. In the year ending June 2025, 26,761 people took up a deal to voluntarily leave the UK. That's 13% up on the previous year and approaching record levels of more than 30,000 returns, seen between 2010 and 2014. Finally, there is the question of £2bn to persuade other countries into returns deals. It's difficult to know how far that cash will travel. Would there be one-off payments or would a government get an annual performance-related pay-out? Rwanda's ministers proved to be such good negotiators they squeezed the UK's wallet for £700m - and received nobody in return. And who would the UK be prepared to hand cash to? Would a Reform government give British taxpayer's money to the Taliban regime with its dire record of the treatment of women? How would such payments work given the UK is a key player in the international sanctions that target its leaders? How many people cross the Channel in small boats?

Paramedic cars and unmarked police vehicles arrived not long afterwards. But the latest from police on Wednesday evening was that the search would continue.

There had been no confirmed sightings of Freeman since the attack, Bush said. He said police had not recovered any firearms from the property where the shooting took place, leading officers to believe Freeman had taken them all with him.

In a comment to public broadcaster DR , foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that “any attempt to interfere in the Kingdom’s internal affairs will obviously be unacceptable.” The move comes after DR reported that Danish intelligence services have uncovered a network of “at least three” people working on “influence operations” in Greenland to drive a wedge between Denmark and the territory , in a bid to pave the way for it to get closer to the United States. The broadcaster said it knew the names of the three American men involved in the operations, but chose not to publish them to protect sources. It said they were previously known to be close to Trump, but it was not immediately clear if they worked on the White House’s order or on their own. It alleged that one of the men visited Greenland to attend meetings and compile a list of potential allies and opponents of Donald Trump’s plans to take over the territory. He also allegedly urged Greenlanders to “point out cases that could be used to put Denmark in a bad light in American media,” DR said. The two other men were allegedly involved in building networks of contacts with politicians, business figures and community leaders to pursue Trump’s plans.

The US state department separately said secretary of state Marco Rubio will meet Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar in Washington on Wednesday, which is expected to take place at 3.15pm ET (7.15pm UK time). When asked on Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier” show if there is a postwar plan for Gaza , Witkoff said: Yes, we’ve got a large meeting in the White House tomorrow, chaired by the president, and it’s a very comprehensive plan we’re putting together on the next day. He did not elaborate further and did not list the meeting’s participants. When asked should Israel be doing anything differently to end the war and secure the release of the hostages, Witkoff said: We think that we’re going to settle this one way or another, certainly before the end of this year. Witkoff said Israel was open to continuing discussions with Palestinian militant group Hamas . He said Hamas had signaled it was open to a settlement. Share Updated at 09.29 CEST",

    "essence": "Palace agree £26m deal for Villarreal winger Pino Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Pino has started in both of Villarreal's La Liga games this season Sami Mokbel Senior football correspondent Published 29 minutes ago 15 Comments Nizaar Kinsella Football reporter Crystal Palace have agreed a deal in principle worth up to £26m with Villarreal for Spain winger Yeremy Pino. The 22-year-old is believed to be open to a move to Selhurst Park and is expected to complete a medical in the coming days. Pino has a £69m release clause, but with there being less than two years left to run on his contract, Villarreal have decided to accept Palace's offer. The Eagles have moved for Pino after England forward Eberechi Eze's £60m move to Arsenal last week. Eze, 27, was Palace's talisman last season, scoring 14 goals and recording 11 assists in 43 games as the club won the FA Cup - the first major trophy in their history. After Palace's 1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest at the weekend, manager Oliver Glasner said he was \"very confident\" the club would make new signings before deadline day on Monday following a quiet transfer window. The club have made only two signings this summer - goalkeeper Walter Benitez's arrival from PSV Eindhoven on a free transfer and defender Borna's Sosa's £3m move from Ajax. Palace have also made a move for Manchester City's 30-year-old Switzerland defender Manuel Akanji, who the club value at £15m. Winger Pino came through Las Palmas' youth set-up before joining Villareal in 2017. He made his full debut in 2020 and scored four goals in 34 league games last season to help Villarreal finish fifth and qualify for the Champions League. Pino has scored three goals in 15 internationals for Spain since making his debut in 2021.

    "essence": "Girl who stabbed teachers fascinated by weapons and war, report says 31 minutes ago Share Save Meleri Williams BBC News Share Save The moment before a teenage girl stabs teachers at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman A teenage girl who stabbed two teachers and a pupil last year had previously been found with a knife, BB gun and war memorabilia in her school bag, a review has found. The girl, who cannot be named due to her age, was 13 at the time of the attack at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Carmarthenshire on 24 April 2024. Earlier this year, she was found guilty of attempted murder and was sentenced to 15 years in detention . A multi-agency review found the girl would have benefited from \"targeted help\" if \"information had been fully shared and assessed\". A joint statement on behalf of Carmarthenshire council, Dyfed-Powys Police, Hywel Dda health board and the school's headteacher said they would work on an action plan. 'I'm going to kill you' - how school day turned to chaos amid stabbing Girl, 14, who stabbed teachers sentenced to 15 years Teacher says school stabbing was like horror movie The independent review by Gladys Rhodes White found the girl was seen as \"quirky\" and had \"unusual interests\" in war memorabilia and Hitler. It added she had a fascination with weapons and would pretend to speak German and Russian. A BB gun [airgun] was found in her bag at a school she attended before she joined Ysgol Dyffryn Aman. In May 2023, the girl threatened to use a knife on another pupil, and a knife was found in her bag during a search in September 2023. These incidents led to her father agreeing to daily bag checks and the review found counselling support was offered, but refused. A referral to the Prevent anti-terrorism programme was considered but not pursued. The report found another referral was made for an Early Help assessment but her father declined it. Teachers Fiona Elias (left), Liz Hopkin (right) and a pupil were injured in the stabbing at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman last April During the trial at Swansea Crown Court, the jury heard the girl carried a knife to school every day as an \"instinct thing\" because she was bullied. On 24 April 2024 the teenager used her father's multi-tool knife and had told other pupils she would stab Ms Elias. She repeatedly stabbed her saying \"I'm going to kill you\" before Ms Hopkin was also stabbed as she intervened. The girl then ran at a 14-year-old pupil with the knife and stabbed her before she was restrained by teacher Darrel Campbell . She told police it was \"one way to be a celebrity\" after she was arrested. Judge Paul Thomas KC said the girl had not shown remorse and had attacked the three for attention. PA Media The teenager attacked the three using her father's multi-tool knife The review suggested the girl had mental health challenges and had a troubled childhood with \"fractured parental relationships\" and exposure to domestic abuse. The school had described her as showing distinctive behaviours that made her stand out from peers developmentally. The review found the school had raised concerns during a school mental health consultation that a knife had been found in her school bag which led to police involvement. The teachers told the independent review bullying was an ongoing issue for the teenager, including on the school bus. Ms Rhodes White said it was likely she was affected by several adverse childhood experiences. While the teenager had been referred to mental health services, the review added it was difficult to know whether her emotional health may have been impacted by neurodiversity, as an assessment or specific diagnosis for neurodiversity was not carried out. The teenager's father told the review he felt services had let his daughter and the family down, but the author suggested a \"pattern\" in agency records of support offers being \"declined or not followed up\". Ms Rhodes White concluded the girl had experienced \"several challenges which agencies had some awareness of at different times and in different ways\". \"Each agency had their own pieces of the jigsaw. In collating all the pieces of the jigsaw, there is a much clearer picture of the extent of concerns around [her] state of mind and her associated behaviours.\" But she said \"no information held by agencies identified a clear ability to foresee the shocking and unexpected events which occurred in April 2024\". Pupils at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman went into lockdown following the stabbings during morning break Ms Rhodes White made a total of 11 recommendations which included that \"consideration should be given at a local and national level to secure sufficient resources and capacity for agencies across all sectors, to be able to respond to ongoing increasing levels of complexity and needs of children and young people, particularly in schools\". She added the \"potential for facilitating better inter-agency sharing of comprehensive, relevant and chronological information\" should be explored. \"When children are subject to delays for assessments, diagnosis or treatment, due to long waiting lists, agencies need to consider how such children are monitored and helped during that time,\" she added. Ms Rhodes White also said agencies should consider prioritising training. In a joint statement, Carmarthenshire council, the headteacher of Ysgol Dyffryn Aman, Dyfed-Powys Police and Hywel Dda health board said they \"acknowledge the challenging and difficult circumstance faced by the victims and the whole community\" after the incident. \"We have received the independent report in respect of the Multi-Agency Professional Forum (MAPF), and will work with all partners to develop an action plan to address its recommendations. \"While it is not usual to publish reviews of this type, or for such a review to be undertaken independently, it was agreed for the Mid and West Wales Safeguarding Children's Board to publish the report on behalf of the agencies involved in the MAPF to ensure all possible efforts have been made to learn from these events and to do so in a transparent and open way.\" Stabbed teacher worried about safety in other schools 'Defiance' from parents over bad school behaviour Violence and behaviour crisis in schools, union says Wales Knife crime Ammanford",

On 21 August, just nine days later, the White House published a list of said offending fixtures – the majority of which include exhibits, programming and artwork that highlight the Black, Latino and LGBTQ+ perspectives on the American project. Included in his bill of particulars was an exhibit that rightly depicts Benjamin Franklin as an enslaver, an art installation that acknowledges race as a social construct and a display that highlights racist voter suppression measures, among others. The assault on the Smithsonian comes wrapped, as it were, as part of a broader attack on democracy, scenes of which we see playing out every day. The federal occupation of Washington DC , the crackdown on free speech on campus, the targeting of Trump’s political opponents, the gerrymandering of democracy – these are interwoven elements of the same structural assault. So with many fires burning across the nation, concerned citizens who are answering the call to fight the destruction of democracy may regard his attack on history and memory as a mere skirmish, a distraction from the herculean struggle against fascism unfolding in the US. But this is a mistake. Trump’s attack on American museums, education and memory, along with his weaponization of racialized resentment to package his authoritarian sympathies as mere patriotism, is a critical dimension of his fascist aims. The fight for democracy cannot avoid it, nor its racial conditions of possibility. Trump’s attacks on the ‘Blacksonian’ have a history in a century-old myth | Saida Grundy Read more Fascism always has a central cultural component, because it relies on the construction of a mythic past . The mythic past is central to fascism because it enables and empowers a sense of grievance by a dominant racial or ethnic group whose consent is crucial to the sustainability of the project. In Maga world, the mythic past was pure, innocent and unsullied by women or Black leaders. In this kind of politics, the nation was once great, a byproduct of the great achievements of the men in the dominant racial group. In short, the assault on the Smithsonian and, more broadly, against truthful history and critical reflection is part of the broader fascist attack on democracy. From this vantage point, racial equality is a threat to the story of the nation’s greatness because only the men of the dominant group can be great. To represent the nation’s founding figures as flawed, as any accurate history would do, is perceived, in this politics, as a kind of treason. The success of the fascist dismantling of democracy is predicated on the widespread systematic failure to see the larger picture. The anti-woke assault that is a key pillar of Trumpism is part of that failure, partly due to the racial blinders and enduring ambivalence of too many in positions of leadership in the media and elsewhere. Those who sign on to the attack on “wokeness” but regard themselves as opponents of the other elements of the fascist assault are under the mistaken assumption that these projects can be disaggregated. In fact, the dismantling of democracy and of racial justice are symbiotically entangled. To support one is to give cover for the others. It is no coincidence that this 'proper' ideology Trump exposes is constitutive of a more well-known strand of fascism – nazism It is clear that the Trump administration understands this relationship and fully weaponizes racist appeals as a foundational piece of its fascist agenda. And if this was once the quiet part, it is now pronounced out loud in official government documents. In an executive order issued on 27 March 2025 titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”, Trump reveals that his mandate to ban “improper ideologies” targets core commitments repudiating a scientific racism that historically naturalized racial hierarchy thereby neutralizing resistance. According to Trump, the problem with the Smithsonian American Art Museum’s exhibit The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture was that it promoted the idea that “race is a human invention”. The understanding that race is a social construct as opposed to a biological fact is perhaps the most fundamental advance in repudiating enslavement, genocide and segregation. Rejecting the idea that racial inequality is natural or pre-ordained – a claim that grounded enslavement and dispossession in America – forms the cornerstone of the modern commitment to a fully inclusive democracy. Trump’s declaration that this cornerstone is “improper” is an effort to turn the clock back, upending the entire American postwar project. It is no coincidence that this “proper” ideology Trump exposes is constitutive of a more well-known strand of fascism – nazism. How else can we understand why Maya Angelou was purged from the Naval Academy library while Adolf Hitler remains? The fight against fascism in the US must be as robust in its embrace of racial equality as Trump’s embrace of outdated ideas about race and racism. The defense of memory, of truthful history, of telling the whole American story rather than ascribing agency in history to the deeds of “great men” is vital to the American democratic project. A pro-democratic education fosters the agency of its citizens by teaching about social movements that overturned entrenched hierarchies which blocked democratic equality and imposed racial tyranny. The story of how ordinary Americans lived and struggled and remade America is essential knowledge in developing and sustaining a multiracial democracy. The Smithsonian has been a vital institution in making this knowledge accessible to the masses. The National Museum of the American Latino and the National Museum of the American Indian, for example, provide artifacts and perspectives about the nation’s westward expansion that challenge the myth of unoccupied territory and manifest destiny. The National Museum of African American History and Culture brings forward the global scale of enslavement as well as its infusion across national institutions, culture and politics. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fascist erasures like Trump’s hide behind the claim that truthful encounters with the past inflame and divide. This instinct is the opposite of the truth. A functioning democracy does not restrict perspectives to those of the dominant group, much less make it illegal to teach alternative ones. A people who cannot remember their past are a people who cannot resist a fascist future. Knowing our history can give us the weapons and wherewithal to battle Trump’s efforts to catapult us back to a time when the majority of Americans lacked both the civic and economic power that we have now. The fight for our museums and for our memory is a critical bulwark against the unraveling of American democracy. It is vital that we fight to protect our repositories before it’s too late.

It’s a visceral pain that never goes away’: Miriam Toews on a memoir of suicide and silence Having fled the strictures of her Mennonite upbringing, the Canadian author searches for meaning in her older sister’s death: ‘She taught me how to stay alive’ Hannah Kingsley-Ma Wed 27 Aug 2025 12.00 CEST Last modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 12.02 CEST Share View image in fullscreen Miriam Toews: ‘Silence and words: both are good, both are failures, both are efforts, and in that effort is where life lies.’ Photograph: Pako Mera/Alamy Long before she became one of Canada’s most celebrated authors, Miriam Toews was an 18-year-old with a restless streak, set on fleeing the strictures of her conservative Mennonite community. Toews’s family descended from Russian Mennonites and spoke Plautdietsch, an unwritten language. They grew up in a world with little privacy, many unofficial rules and the threat of excommunication. Toews and a boyfriend had planned a bike trip across Europe, one in which they would sit on the grave of John Keats and smoke too many cigarettes. Before she left, her older sister Marj asked a favor: would Toews write letters to her while she was away? Marj, then 24, had recently moved back home and was in a period of deep depression. She had stopped talking, but she would still write. “She was so sick,” says Toews, sitting across from me at a picnic table in Toronto’s Trinity Bellwoods park. Toews began writing to her sister, partly because she loved talking to her and partly because she hoped it would save her life. “Which, of course, is a ridiculous idea,” says Toews. “That me writing letters would keep her alive. But I really took it seriously.” Anyone with a formidable older sister knows their unrivaled power. They are a portal to the wider world, brave in their primacy. Marj Toews was one such older sister. She was six years older than Miriam, who worshipped her from day one. “She was so much the subject of my investigation into this world,” Toews tells me. “I needed her. Who she was to me was something so necessary.” Marj has never stopped being a subject of necessary investigation for Miriam Toews: both her remarkable life, and her death by suicide at the age of 52. Since that European excursion with her ex-boyfriend, Toews has authored 10 books, one of which, Women Talking, was adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring Frances McDormand and Rooney Mara. Her latest, A Truce That Is Not Peace, was released on Tuesday and is her first memoir written from her perspective. (Her first work of nonfiction, Swing Low, was written in the voice of her father). View image in fullscreen Frances McDormand as Scarface Janz in director Sarah Polley’s adaptation of Toews’s 2018 novel, Women Talking. Photograph: Michael Gibson Toews is also an enthusiastic grandmother of four. She lives near downtown Toronto, with her 90-year old mother, Elvira; her partner; and her daughter Georgia’s family, including their two young sons. When Toews and I first encounter each other, a snaking line of hand-holding toddlers in fluorescent safety vests are weaving their way into the park. A smiling Toews stands vigil as they pass, trying to spot her grandson in the mix. It’s a muggy morning, and we, like the children, are in search of shade. At 61, Toews is older now than her older sister ever was, and around the same age her father was when he too died of suicide. Melvin Toews was a beloved schoolteacher in their home town of Steinbach in the Manitoba province of central Canada. He was a deeply devout man, a proud champion of his daughters and his wife, and somebody who experienced bipolar disorder his entire life. “My dad sort of had to be mentally ill in secret in that community,” says Toews. There was the danger of it being misinterpreted as a lack of faith. “If your faith was stronger, if you were a better Mennonite, you wouldn’t be depressed,” she says. His illness sometimes brought him into sustained periods of silence. The whole first year after Toews was born, he did not speak. It makes sense that though we are ostensibly here to talk about A Truce That Is Not Peace, our conversation stays mostly with both of them: the complexity of their deaths and the totality of how much they are missed. No matter how much time has passed, their absence is still raw. Becoming a grandmother has only intensified this feeling: Toews cannot help but think about how much Marj would have enjoyed this next stage of caregiving. Toews’s work is often centered on the question of why her father and her sister both chose to end their lives, and in A Truce That Is Not Peace, she acknowledges that she will never find the answer. It is that very paradox that keeps her on the page, turning it over again to try to understand them as they wished to be understood, and to stay close to them now that they are gone. Why do I still need to write? Why do I still need to make this thing in order to connect with other human beings so I don’t feel so alone and weird? It’s so embarrassing When she wrote the book, Toews had just turned 60. She was tending to both her young grandchildren and her elderly mother, whom she has previously called the love of her life. (Elvira Toews, a Lamborghini-loving, Toronto Blue Jays fan who bucked tradition to go to graduate school and become a social worker, leaps off the page in so many of Toews’s books. She is the kind of woman who eats a daily bowl of vanilla ice-cream with chocolate syrup, banana slices and walnuts, and when it’s over says: “How ’bout another one?”) Miriam Toews was already one of Canada’s bestselling authors, but the success of Women Talking launched her into a new level of international recognition, winning all of Canada’s top literary prizes and plaudits from everyone from Margaret Atwood to Brad Pitt , who was a co-producer on the film adaptation. Yet, she could not shake the feeling that her need to continue to write was somehow newly shameful. “I was grappling with the urgency of it,” says Toews in regards to her writing, “And on the other hand the mortification. Why do I still need to write? Why do I still need to make this thing in order to connect with other human beings so I don’t feel so alone and weird? It’s so embarrassing.” She asked herself: hadn’t she said it all? What was left in her life to mine? Her nine previous books had already reflected back on many of her own experiences. Maybe it was time to finally heed the message she had received all those early years from her Mennonite forefathers: keep quiet. That would be dignified, Toews insisted. “I just wish I could be like a calm, serene, bemused grandmotherly person with wisdom,” says Toews. “But it seems as though – it seems like I haven’t really achieved that. And I have to understand that I never will.” At some point, we had to stop to laugh: it seemed too wonderfully Toewsian that while she was talking about the indignity of an older female writer still expressing herself, we were surrounded by individuals who were contorting themselves into strange, acrobatic shapes. One was a shirtless man bending over a park bench like a stretchy rainbow, the other dangling frog-legged and upside down from a fabric sling strung up in a tree. “God,” says Toews. “It’s so perfect.” This time around, Toews is changing the way she tells these stories. Most of her previous books contain autobiographical information told through the prism of fiction. A Truce That Is Not Peace takes an inverse approach. The central conceit is a fictional prompt from a fictional conference in Mexico City, a send-up of the highfalutin literary circles Toews now finds herself in. The idea is something like this: organizers of this “Conversación” want her to provide an answer for why she writes. She sends them many attempts: associative, rangy, exasperated, rueful, funny ruminations on the futility of writing. Eventually, the committee uninvites her. The book is in many ways about the inherent failures of language. Marj Toews, like her father Melv before her, would fall into long periods of silence in her suffering. A Truce That Is Not Peace is constantly weighing Toews’s own urgent need to write against her sister’s and her father’s choice to periodically forsake words altogether. “Silence. Suicide. Writing. Within all of these, we are holding,” writes Toews. “Does her silence hold the perfect expression of her suffering? Is her silence a communications success, my writing a failure?” Silence, suicide and writing: these are sisters of sorts in Toews’s questioning mind: “Are writing and suicide related?” she asks. “The same thing? Or estranged relatives, at least? Angry siblings whose origins are the same. An attempt – a fragment of an attempt – to save life, preserve life, to freeze it in a moment, to end what is real, to survive by ending. To preserve, in silence, what is authentic.” Yet Toews is not cynical about the project of writing. It is nothing short of a choice to keep on living, long after we have buried our beloved dead. “Why must I draw a comparison between writing and suicide?” asks Toews. “To stay with her. To stay with them. Yes, you can imagine my suffering. Yeah, you fucking can. Try! Stay with me.” Despite their serious subject matter, Toews’s books have a rallying spirit to them, an angry jolt of energy that comes from a perpetual spirit of adolescent rebellion. In A Truce That Is Not Peace, that looseness feels more radical in nature, entirely liberated from plot. Toews has a deep distrust of narrative’s more controlling impulses. Perhaps it is because Toews has always been sensitive to modes of control, from the strict traditional Mennonite orthodoxy she grew up under. Or maybe it is because of the way some people in her religious community rushed to come up with neat and inaccurate explanations for why her father had died by suicide, which hurt Toews more than it provided comfort. Or maybe it was the new experience of having her novel about survivors of gas-facilitated sexual assault be made into a feature film and fully absorbed into the alienating awards cycle machine. “The reality is that [director] Sarah Polley did an amazing job,” says Toews. “We talked about it throughout, she was so sensitive to the whole thing, and it was an amazing experience.” The irony was not lost on Toews that going to Hollywood meant losing her authorial voice on a novel that was literally just women talking to one another. A Truce That Is Not Peace’s nonlinear structure makes it immune to such dangers. “I was thinking, OK, there’s no way this is going to be adapted,” laughs Toews. “Like, adapt this, motherfuckers. Just try.” With my mother, with my aunts, with my female cousins, there was a subversive humor that we could all rally. It was always against our oppressors There is of course a complicated answer to why write, and then there’s a simple one. “Why do I write?” writes Toews matter-of-factly towards the end of A Truce That Is Not Peace. “Because she asked me to.” Marj and Mel Toews introduced her to the world of books, a world that Toews thinks saved her life. “I love them and I miss them so much,” says Toews. “My sister, my God. It’s a visceral pain and it never goes away. It lessens, it lightens, it ebbs and flows.” It’s hard to overstate the patriarchal conditions Marj and Miriam Toews’s family were all subject to. Many of the women they grew up with lived hard lives. Their grandmother – their mother’s mother – buried six of her 13 children in infancy. Their father’s mother often cried out in her sleep, speaking the name of a group of men she grew up with in a little girl’s voice. She stole and drank bottles of vanilla extract during the day, lining her purse with a tea towel so that the glass would not make a sound. When Marj was 10, she was abducted off the street by a group of teenage boys in a car who dropped her off in front of her house hours later “doused with a vile brown liquid”. “Don’t be alarmed if I scream in my sleep,” Toews’s own mother cheerfully sometimes tells her family. But the women they grew up with also had a deep communion with one another that was borne out of the intense gender separation they experienced. They sang together. They raised their families alongside one another. And they laughed – a lot. “With my mother, with my aunts, with my female cousins, there was a subversive humor that we could all rally around and share. It was always against our oppressors, the rules that were put on us,” says Toews. Nobody made her laugh harder than Marj. “She was so funny,” says Toews. And what was it that made them laugh so hard? “That shared thing,” says Toews smiling, in the sly knowing language of sisters, “whatever that shared thing is.” A shared sense of humor is an underwater cable that connects so many siblings and so many of Toews’s books. It’s the language of subterfuge. What better way is there to chip away at an unreasonably sanctimonious authority than to laugh at it? Toews tells me that when she gave A Truce That Is Not Peace to her mother to read, her mother laughed and laughed, telling Toews: “It’s all true!” I ask Toews whether she dreams about Marj. “I do,” she tells me. “The details are often the same. She’s always telling me she’s OK. And she’s always looking good and happy. I would like to have that dream every night. Every night. It’s always a little bit hard waking up. But it’s always good to have the dream.” Miriam Toews: ‘I needed to write about these women. I could have been one of them’ Read more A Truce That Is Not Peace is dedicated to Marj. It contains some of those old letters between the two of them, back when Miriam was 18 and left for her overseas biking trip. Only one is written by Marj. It ends with her saying: “I very much miss being able to call you anytime or just come over + hang out. A sister’s place is in many ways even better than a friend’s – you’re always welcome, don’t have to make arrangements etc. etc. Can stay long or short, clean out the fridge, read the paper etc In short, not be on one’s best behaviour.” Toews’s writing is a way of building a suspended sister’s place where the correspondence is ongoing. It’s a place to go to not be on one’s best behavior. It’s both the dream and the waking up. “She taught me how to stay alive,” writes Toews. “Silence and words: both are good, both are failures, both are efforts, and in that effort is where life lies – not lies , but maybe it does – but where it exists. And the fragments in between are the spaces where she and I meet.” In the US, you can call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org .

Photograph: ABACA/Shutterstock Opinion Cosmetic surgery Why does the Maga elite love conspicuous cosmetic surgery? Arwa Mahdawi Mar-a-Lago face is suddenly everywhere – and there is a version for both men and women Wed 27 Aug 2025 12.00 CEST Share A group of chimpanzees in Zambia have been very busy putting grass in their ears and sticks up their bum for fashion purposes. Scientists studying the behaviour think that one influential chimp started the trend and, instead of the rest of the gang going, “mate, you look like an idiot”, they all just followed suit. Clearly we haven’t evolved from apes that much because a similar phenomenon is at play with the billionaire and Make America Great Again (Maga) set, who are spending enormous sums of money acquiring identical plastic faces. The trend is so widespread that it’s even got a name: Mar-a-Lago face . Among women the look is characterised by huge lips that look as if they could suck up a small child whole, frozen facial expressions, and cheeks so bulbous you could hide a gerbil underneath them. Men also have the slick frozen faces , but instead of bigger lips they’re pairing them with bigger jaws. In recent years, surgeons have reported a large increase of male clients demanding stronger jawlines. I wouldn’t normally be snarky about someone’s looks but let’s be clear: nobody is born with Mar-a-Lago face. These are not human faces, they are luxury meat-masks meant to signal wealth and in-group belonging. People such as Laura Loomer, Kristi Noem, and Matt Gaetz can afford excellent surgeons and subtle cosmetic work but, unless they’ve all had botched procedures, it seems they deliberately chose to look like AI-generated caricatures. One can only surmise that they live in such weird little bubbles, where everyone is addicted to filler, that this sort of conspicuous consumption of cosmetic surgery has become desirable. Having the right look is certainly desirable to optics-obsessed Donald Trump, whose chief concern for his underlings appears to be how they perform on TV. In 2017, an Axios report claimed that Trump wanted his female staff to “ dress like women ” and demanded that his male employees have a “certain look.” Over the years it seems the “certain look” has only become more extreme. An obsession with traditional gender norms also seems to factor into today’s exaggerated aesthetics. Earlier this year a New York-based dermatologist told Politico that fashion often shifts to more traditional gender expression in culturally conservative times. “It’s ironic … that they’re so against trans-ness and gender-affirming care for trans people,” the dermatologist said of Trump’s inner orbit. “Because, you know, they’re all doing their own gender-affirming care.” The Zambian bum-stick chimps seem positively sophisticated in comparison.

Revenues in established UK shops fell 6.6% as the leisurewear company struggled to beat strong trading last year, when it received a boost from the men’s Euro 2024 football tournament and women’s growing taste for sports footwear such as Adidas’s Samba and Gazelle. The company said it had invested in cutting prices online amid “tough comparatives”, especially on footwear for women and children. Debenhams may sell Pretty Little Thing and shut distribution hub Read more The sales slide in the UK in the 13 weeks to 2 August contributed to a 3% fall in underlying group sales in the period, with sales increasing only in the Asia Pacific region. Sales in the US fell 2.3%, although this was better than had been expected amid the impact of new import tariffs introduced by the Trump administration this year. Despite falling sales, shares in JD rose 5% on Wednesday morning, reflecting relief that the company confirmed it was still on track to produce full-year profits in line with expectations – although those have been downgraded in recent months. The company also announced a £100m share buyback. The poor UK sales for JD, however, are likely to increase fears of a tougher consumer environment, which hit retail share prices across the London stock market on Tuesday. Régis Schultz, the chief executive of the retail group, which operates the JD Sports fashion chain globally but also owns the Finish Line and Shoe Palace chains in the US, Sport Zone and Courir in mainland Europe, and Blacks and Go Outdoors in the UK, said: “Across our regions and fascias, in general we see a resilient consumer, albeit very selective on their purchases. We therefore remain cautious on the trading environment going into [the second half of the year].” He said there had been an “improved performance” in the US after several product launches were deferred into the second quarter and stronger sales trends in clothing and online. In mainland Europe and the UK he said there was “a good underlying performance” in clothing and newer footwear lines despite tough market conditions. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty Images The Spin newsletter Sport ‘I’ll bat anywhere for England’: in-form Jordan Cox confident his moment will come The Essex wicketkeeper-batter, currently dazzling in the Hundred, has the self-belief he can put past setbacks behind him Taha Hashim Wed 27 Aug 2025 11.23 CEST Last modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 12.09 CEST Share J ordan Cox’s timing has been off. Not with the bat – it’s pinged off the middle for some time. The 24-year-old averages more than 60 in the County Championship since joining Essex from Kent two years ago, and he has serious white-ball pedigree. He meets the Spin at the Oval four days after his unbeaten 29-ball 86 in the Hundred on this ground. “It’s the best place in the world to play cricket,” he says. No, the luck hasn’t gone his way with England. Cox was readying himself for a Test debut in New Zealand last November, penned in as the keeper-bat while Jamie Smith took paternity leave for the three-match series. But days out from the first Test, the stand-in broke his thumb while batting in the nets. It was a moment on which careers can turn. In came Jacob Bethell as Ollie Pope moved down the order, the former establishing himself as English cricket’s Next Big Thing. Cox had to wrestle with a dream snatched at the last, heal up and make his case once again. Government gives £1.5m to grassroots cricket and decries £35m Tory ‘fantasy’ Read more “The winter was definitely a big step back,” says Cox. “But I’ve spoken to a lot of people just talking about how it must have happened for a reason. I keep telling myself that I clearly wasn’t ready for Test cricket yet. And that was someone telling me that if I do get an opportunity, I’ll be ready for it then.” But the misfortune didn’t stop there. Included in the Test squad to face Zimbabwe in May, Cox had to pull out after sustaining an abdominal injury while making a hundred for Essex. How did it feel this time round? “Absolutely fine,” he says. “Unless someone got injured, I wasn’t going to play. So it wasn’t really upsetting for me.” He offers a slight correction. “But it was because I love to be around the group and I love to hit them well in the nets, show the boys I’ll put them first and all that sort of stuff, which coaches love, and players love to see other people help out. I was upset I couldn’t do that for the lads. But it was also: ‘OK, when can I get back fit and when can I start scoring runs again to put my name back up on that pedestal?’” Cox repeats his desire to “bash the door down” with runs, a cliched mantra but one, to be fair, he is following. Matt Walker, once his head coach at Kent, is an assistant coach at the Oval Invincibles where Cox is the leading run-scorer in this year’s Hundred. “There is just an unwavering confidence about him,” says Walker. “I think he believes he’s the best player whenever he takes the field. It’s not in an outwardly arrogant way. Sometimes with players that have a front, a bit of a swagger or some sort of arrogance to them, it can be masking some insecurities. I don’t think that is the case with Jordan, I think there has always been this complete confidence in his game.” Walker says that behind the self-belief is a “smart-thinking cricketer”. Which takes us to that 86 against Welsh Fire, 10 sixes included, scoops to go with the power over midwicket. It was notable how he shuffled around in his crease, jumping wide of off-stump to shovel his Essex teammate Paul Walter’s medium pace into the crowd. Having kept wicket to Walter in the T20 Blast, Cox knew what was coming. “When I play with people I’m always trying to see what they do, what their go-to ball is under pressure, all that sort of stuff. If I then do get an opportunity to play against them, I’m like one step ahead. “I do a bit of work with Lou and Freddie [analysts at the Invincibles], just to talk about the percentages of how many times they’re going to hit the stumps in 20 balls. For example, Paulie there, he was one in 20. So it was like: ‘OK, if he bowls me, then that’s that one ball in 20. So take the risk of moving around the crease.’ He’s six foot nine, or whatever he is, so not many are going to hit the stumps anyway.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images Cox remains limited to only five England caps: two Twenty20s against Australia last September, with three one-day internationals away to the West Indies in October and November. He returned a high score of 17 across five innings, a less than ideal start at the top level. Cox says he didn’t feel ready for the ODIs having barely played in the buildup; he was a squad member on the Test tour of Pakistan that preceded the series. “It was tough, but unfortunately that’s international cricket. I missed my opportunity there.” Walker was on that tour of the Caribbean as part of England’s coaching staff. “He got caught out a couple of times with a short ball early on in his innings but he looks like he’s worked really hard at it,” Walker says. “He’s definitely added it to his practice, being a bit more diligent around the short ball.” Walker sees a player who has expanded his leg-side game and is “putting pressure on that England squad”. Nonetheless, Cox remains on the outer, excluded from the white-ball group to face South Africa and Ireland in September. Breaking into a Test middle order featuring Joe Root, Harry Brook and Ben Stokes adds to the challenge. “If you’ve got the No 1 and 2 Test batsmen in the world, I can’t imagine I’m going to squeeze them apart,” Cox says. “If they went: ‘Jordan, Ashes series, good luck, you’re opening.’ I’ll be like: ‘Sweet, take that on.’ I’m not going to say: ‘Oh, I don’t think that’s for me.’ It’s an England game. If they want me to bat 10, I’ll bat 10. If they want me to open, I’ll open. I’ll bat absolutely anywhere for England, and I always will.” This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin. To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions .

    "essence": "Parents of teenager who took his own life sue OpenAI 42 minutes ago Share Save Nadine Yousif BBC News Share Save The Raine Family A California couple is suing OpenAI over the death of their teenage son, alleging its chatbot, ChatGPT, encouraged him to take his own life. The lawsuit was filed by Matt and Maria Raine, parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, in the Superior Court of California on Tuesday. It is the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death. The family included chat logs between Mr Raine, who died in April, and ChatGPT that show him explaining he has suicidal thoughts. They argue the programme validated his \"most harmful and self-destructive thoughts\". In a statement, OpenAI told the BBC it was reviewing the filing. \"We extend our deepest sympathies to the Raine family during this difficult time,\" the company said. It also published a note on its website on Tuesday that said \"recent heartbreaking cases of people using ChatGPT in the midst of acute crises weigh heavily on us\". It added that \"ChatGPT is trained to direct people to seek professional help,\" such as the 988 suicide and crisis hotline in the US or the Samaritans in the UK. The company acknowledged, however, that \"there have been moments where our systems did not behave as intended in sensitive situations\". Warning: This story contains distressing details. The lawsuit, obtained by the BBC, accuses OpenAI of negligence and wrongful death. It seeks damages as well as \"injunctive relief to prevent anything like this from happening again\". According to the lawsuit, Mr Raine began using ChatGPT in September 2024 as a resource to help him with school work. He was also using it to explore his interests, including music and Japanese comics, and for guidance on what to study at university. In a few months, \"ChatGPT became the teenager's closest confidant,\" the lawsuit says, and he began opening up to it about his anxiety and mental distress. By January 2025, the family says he began discussing methods of suicide with ChatGPT. Mr Raine also uploaded photographs of himself to ChatGPT showing signs of self harm, the lawsuit says. The programme \"recognised a medical emergency but continued to engage anyway,\" it adds. According to the lawsuit, the final chat logs show that Mr Raine wrote about his plan to end his life. ChatGPT allegedly responded: \"Thanks for being real about it. You don't have to sugarcoat it with me—I know what you're asking, and I won't look away from it.\" That same day, Mr Raine was found dead by his mother, according to the lawsuit. Getty Images The Raines' lawsuit names OpenAI's CEO and co-founder Sam Altman as a defendant, along with unnamed engineers and employees who worked on ChatGPT The family alleges that their son's interaction with ChatGPT and his eventual death \"was a predictable result of deliberate design choices\". They accuse OpenAI of designing the AI programme \"to foster psychological dependency in users,\" and of bypassing safety testing protocols to release GPT-4o, the version of ChatGPT used by their son. The lawsuit lists OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman as a defendant, as well as unnamed employees, managers and engineers who worked on ChatGPT. In its public note shared on Tuesday, OpenAI said the company's goal is to be \"genuinely helpful\" to users rather than \"hold people's attention\". It added that its models have been trained to steer people who express thoughts of self-harm towards help. The Raines lawsuit is not the first time concerns have been raised about AI and mental health. In an essay published last week in the New York Times, writer Laura Reiley outlined how her daughter, Sophie, confided in ChatGPT before taking her own life. Ms Reiley said the programme's \"agreeability\" in its conversations with users helped her daughter mask a severe mental health crisis from her family and loved ones. \"AI catered to Sophie's impulse to hide the worst, to pretend she was doing better than she was, to shield everyone from her full agony,\" Ms Reiley wrote. She called on AI companies to find ways to better connect users with the right resources. In response to the essay, a spokeswoman for OpenAI said it was developing automated tools to more effectively detect and respond to users experiencing mental or emotional distress. If you are suffering distress or despair and need support, you could speak to a health professional, or an organisation that offers support. Details of help available in many countries can be found at Befrienders Worldwide: www.befrienders.org . In the UK, a list of organisations that can help is available at bbc.co.uk/actionline .

We would like to hear from people on how they feel about food inflation and if it’s affected their shopping habits Guardian community team Wed 27 Aug 2025 11.16 CEST Last modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 11.18 CEST Share Food inflation in the UK has hit 4.2% this month with there being a “significant increase” in the cost of staple foods such as butter and eggs. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said prices had risen at their fastest pace for 18 months. Those on low incomes are most affected by food price inflation because they spend disproportionately more of their monthly budgets on the essentials of life compared with the wealthiest, who have more room to cut discretionary spending.

It’s a stirring look at the city’s refusal to lie down Jack Seale Wed 27 Aug 2025 11.13 CEST Last modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 12.14 CEST Share I t’s hard to quantify the significance of Hurricane Katrina: the combination of a historic natural disaster and cold systemic indifference towards its impoverished African American victims makes it perhaps the most significant event in 21st-century Black American history. It’s no surprise, then, that more than one major documentary series has been made to mark 20 years since wind, water and a whole lot of racism devastated New Orleans, or that leading cinematic auteurs of two consecutive generations, Spike Lee and Ryan Coogler, have each executive-produced their own. But watching Katrina: Come Hell and High Water, you do wish Lee and Coogler had got on the phone to check they weren’t doubling up too much. The new three-parter – the Lee one that arrives on Netflix to coincide with the week of the anniversary, has its impact dulled by the pre-existence of Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time , the Coogler one which came out on Disney+ and National Geographic a month ago. For much of the screen time, this is a less comprehensive rendering of the same story, using many of the same clips and interviewees. That tale is essential, however, and powerfully told. Katrina, a Category 5 hurricane on a scale that goes up to 5, hit New Orleans on 29 August 2005. An order to evacuate the city came late, and many residents with limited economic means didn’t have a way of getting out anyway. New Orleans is a bowl, with much of it below sea level; floodwalls and drainage canals had been built to protect against storm surges, but they were inadequate and, after the hurricane struck, entire neighbourhoods flooded. With many dead – 1,392 at the final count – and thousands effectively refugees in their own city, help was unbelievably slow in arriving: the local authorities were unprepared, and George W Bush’s national government seemed simply not to care. View image in fullscreen Impassioned … Toni and Adonika Landry in Katrina: Come Hell and High Water. Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix Come Hell and High Water is more impassioned and elegiac than the detailed but still furious Race Against Time. Here we have a less robust timeline of events as Katrina approached, and a narrower picture of why New Orleans was so vulnerable. But this film is better at conveying the unimaginable horror of the rapidly rising waters, and is strong, too, on the racism that pervaded the media and political elites’ reaction to the aftermath: as people dying of thirst took supplies that were lying in abandoned shops, the line quickly became that “looting” was out of control and that “order” had to be restored. As is demonstrated here, similarly stricken white people would not have received the same treatment. None of that was absent from the other show, though. Your best advice is to watch Race Against Time instead of the first two episodes of Come Hell and High Water. Come back, though, for the closing documentary feature directed by Spike Lee: a rich oral history of the city in the two decades since the hurricane, this film rattles off the myriad injustices that continued to devastate New Orleans after the waters receded, as reported by creative figures such as the actor Wendell Pierce and the musician Branford Marsalis, among Katrina survivors. We hear how the city’s unique culture was deliberately and methodically prevented from reasserting itself, starting with insurance companies and banks ruthlessly taking what they said they were owed. A federally funded rebuilding drive was weighted in favour of wealthier areas, assigning money based on buildings’ previous values. Public services were markedly underfunded. Black teachers were laid off. Many local residents, notably the Black middle classes, left for Atlanta or Houston. These and numerous other issues – rising crime leading to boom time for privatised prisons, gentrification turning Black areas into white ones – are rather hurled at the viewer with scant evidence or context. The overall point is very clear and there is no reason to doubt any of the angry assertions made; it would just be nice to hear more about each one before we pivot to the next. The only editorial device the director employs, the flashing up of key phrases from the interviews as captions that appear as the person says them, feels patronising and oddly flippant. Lee is finely attuned, however, to how the spirit, the culture, the soul of a city can survive the worst hardships, so he ends on a note of defiant joy. New Orleans, he tells us, is coming alive again, and refusing to be a template for the destruction of any community that doesn’t conform. Come Hell and High Water is a stirring tribute to what has been lost and what has been stolen, but it assures us that New Orleans will never be gone, even if it will never be the same.

I felt great in them, like a chip off the old block Amy Fleming Wed 27 Aug 2025 11.01 CEST Share I loved Dad’s old suede jacket. He’d had it for as long as I could remember, an artefact from his more rock’n’roll days, and it had been worn into buttery softness. When the lining finally disintegrated, and the suede thinned to imminent oblivion, he decided to retire it. But I couldn’t bear to see it go. I tried it on and felt great – like a chip off the old block. It wasn’t at all heavy and the softness extended to the buttons that were covered in matching suede material. Sure, it had a patina of London grime and smelled of Old Holborn tobacco, but I thought it was cool. I was about 13 and couldn’t afford to buy a suede jacket in a million years, so I claimed it as my own, and set about bringing it back to life, like the singing mending mice in Bagpuss. Mum and I picked out some blue fabric, which was incongruously bright, in hindsight. After she relined the jacket for me (a woman of many talents, she papered that wall behind me in the picture, too) it felt as good as new, if not better. What had been part of my dad’s identity became mine and I wore it until sections of suede had broken free and started dangling skankily into my tea – at which point it was unquestionably deceased. I had a habit of nicking Dad’s clothes, and they often became some of my favourite adolescent looks. The threadbare checked shirt I used as a nightshirt (and decorated by sewing tiny novelty buttons all over it – toadstools, pineapples and what-have-you); the suit jacket I took when I got a bit older, and wore as a coat (it wasn’t very warm, but who cares when you’re a teenager?); the pleated, heavy-wool kilt from when he was a small boy that I wore as a miniskirt. I was a big fan of badges and a Playboy bunny one was my favourite at the time. With its combination of cute rabbit and the naughty, sexy, adult world it signified – plus the sense that I was being subversive by wearing it – that bunny caught my imagination as womanhood loomed The hat must be mentioned, too. Everyone was wearing bowler hats or wide-brimmed variations in the 80s – Bananarama, Debbie Gibson, Madonna – but my hat inspiration came from the 1985 cover of Face magazine with Felix Howard who, at 13, had starred in Madonna’s Open Your Heart video. For this iconic shot, he was styled in a black felt hat with a strip of newsprint reading “Killer” tucked into the ribbon. Also of note: the Chinese lucky dolls I’d hung from the top button of the jacket. These were from one of my all-time favourite childhood shops, the late Neal Street East emporium in London’s Covent Garden. It was full of treasures from China, Japan and beyond – and had a “basement bazaar” of thrillingly affordable nicknacks, such as the fan you can just about see on the wall behind me in the hat picture. It was a magical place and everything I ever bought there felt magical, too. Explore more on these topics Fashion My favourite childhood outfit Young people features Share Reuse this content",

Photograph: Double Fine Summer games previews PC Keeper is the ecological ‘fever dream’ where you play as – checks notes – a lighthouse Double Fine’s latest is a whimsical action-adventure that takes inspiration from real-life biology as much as cult fantasy movies from the 1980s Lewis Gordon Wed 27 Aug 2025 11.00 CEST Last modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 11.59 CEST Share K eeper is staking a bold claim to be the oddest game ever published by Microsoft. The setting is weird: an iridescent, far-future imagining of New England where organic and non-organic matter mingle in strange, alchemical ways. And the characters are undeniably quirky: one is a bird called Twig whose beak is made from driftwood. Strangest of all: you play as a lighthouse that has inexplicably become animate, sprouting tiny, spindly little legs to carry its wibbling, wobbling body. In the sea of action-hero young men and, to a lesser degree, women, the lighthouse stands out as an unlikely star. Creative lead Lee Petty is a little fuzzy on the details of how it came to be. Rather, he talks about the creation of the protagonist as he does the broader action-adventure experience: as if it rose out of his subconscious. Despite the ostensible absurdity, Petty believes there is a certain intuition about it. “You have a light, and light has a very strong connection with life,” he says. “You can imagine the verbs for the player, and the actions, puzzles, mechanics that fall out of that.” View image in fullscreen ‘Life has continued to evolve in completely unexpected ways’ … Keeper. Photograph: Double Fine The lighthouse’s illuminated beacon is the primary way you interact with the game’s teeming island setting. In “unfocused” mode, you direct the beam about a fantastical environment, causing foliage and small creatures to grow, change and morph. In “focused” mode, the light’s power is concentrated: larger objects undergo transformation while some materials are repelled or attracted; this is the basis of the game’s more involved puzzles. Keeper’s world is one of gauzy, psychedelic purples and deep, verdant greens. We see bioluminescent rock formations, tree-sized tendrils protruding from their gigantic flower heads, and a gorgeous, whale-like creature floating through the sky, vegetation growing unexpectedly on its back. This ecological extravaganza is partly inspired by 1980s fantasy movies such as The Dark Crystal and The NeverEnding Story, “weird” and “imperfect” works, admits Petty, yet “so earnest in their desire to create a world that you haven’t seen before”. View image in fullscreen Gauzy, psychedelic purples … Keeper. Photograph: Double Fine Real life proved just as inspiring for the creative lead. During Covid lockdowns, he walked alone in the pretty foothills south of his San Francisco home. Petty gazed at the abundant vegetation while meditating on what the planet might look like should humanity cease to exist. He was also reading books and watching movies about mycelium networks, thinking deeply about the interconnectedness and interdependence of ecosystems. This deluge of feelings, real-world circumstances and reference material coalesced as a fever dream, says Petty. He envisioned a “a weird island, a sort of surreal, post-human thing, where life has continued to evolve in completely unexpected ways”. The game’s genesis arrived shortly after Petty’s award-winning employer Double Fine, maker of trippy platformer Psychonauts 2 , Stacking and many other idiosyncratic titles, was acquired by Microsoft. The new management was receptive to his experimental idea: he was given the time and resources to explore the concept before locking down its form. Keeper seems to have embodied the laid-back approach of its making: the vibe is languorously dreamy with many opportunities to slow down and smell the enchanting and totally bizarre roses. “You’re not rushed along, you’re not given mission objectives. There are no pop-ups on the screen with meta-rewards,” says Petty. “You’re kind of left to dwell in the space.” And yet there is a grim irony that may yet sour this sweet, whimsical experience: Keeper’s vivid celebration of life is being funded by Microsoft at a time when the company’s cloud-based storage platform Azure has been used to facilitate the preparation of deadly airstrikes and military operations in Gaza and the West Bank. The the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has called for the boycott of Microsoft and Xbox products. Recently, unionised workers at French studio Arkane, also owned by Microsoft, issued an open letter stating that its parent company “has no place being accomplice of a genocide”. Microsoft has since claimed to be investigating the use of its platform in this manner, which is, it claims, a breach of the terms of service. Petty, of course, is far removed from the decisions made by his bosses at Microsoft, and he stresses as much. He says this is the “downside” of being owned by a much larger organisation, one whose purview extends far beyond entertainment. “I’m not in control. Double Fine is not necessarily tacitly endorsing anything of our parent company,” he says. “We’re just trying to make great games.” Keeper is due for release on PC and Xbox in October Explore more on these topics PC Summer games previews Games Xbox Xbox series S/X features Share Reuse this content",

Social media thrives on mimicry �� but this was a step too far Esme Hewitt At its best, the internet can be a space where people share stories and ideas. But the line between inspiration and theft can easily become blurred Wed 27 Aug 2025 11.00 CEST Last modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 12.14 CEST Share L ast month, I wrote an article about being adopted by a British couple during the era of China’s one-child policy . Three days after the story ran in a national newspaper , my phone buzzed with a flurry of messages from a friend who had sent me a TikTok post by an influencer telling her life story to camera. Twenty seconds into her video, my jaw plummeted. She had recited entire sections of my article, word for word, to her 20,000 followers. She didn’t even have the courtesy to give me a credit. When I wrote that piece, the idea of exposing personal details of my life to scrutiny or criticism was terrifying. Even so, it felt right to share this story in the hope that others might find comfort if they too had had similar experiences. What I wasn’t expecting was for someone to take my words and claim them as their own. The influencer spoke of her adoption but she took sections of the article in which I discussed my intimate thoughts and feelings, and passed these off as her own. She recited how “in my early twenties, I measured my self-worth in how many matches I got on Tinder or how many boys I was texting”, and having “imagined a childhood in China and being raised by my biological parents”. Taking the exact phrases I had written, she reposted them to her followers, and then thanked users in the comments when they complimented her. I understand that imitation is the highest form of flattery but this was blatant stealing. View image in fullscreen Esme Hewitt’s article about her life that appeared in the Times, and was plagiarised on TikTok. I commented on the video: “Have you heard of plagiarism?” Soon afterwards, her husband appeared in my DMs on Instagram. He told me I wasn’t “the only Asian in the world adopted in that time frame”, dismissed me as “not that special” and even claimed I had copied his wife’s original videos. I called them both crazy and immediately blocked him. After this, I felt I had to set the record straight. So the next morning I made a video arguing that the influencer was plagiarising my work and included clips of her video alongside my article as proof. In response to my TikTok , she and her husband posted a video, insisting: “Her story and experience is also my story and experience … I did not steal her story.” Hours later she posted another video, apologising for using my words and saying she was sorry for any hurt feelings, and that her intent was not “malicious”. She also messaged me privately to apologise. Plagiarism – passing off someone else’s words or ideas as your own without sourcing or credit – is a career-ending offence in most industries. At university, it was drilled into me that you could be expelled if your essay included too much text that borrowed from existing work without giving it credit. The message was explicit: you do not plagiarise. View image in fullscreen Esme Hewitt Yet on social media the message is far more ambiguous. While TikTok explains that copyright protects “original works of authorship” and bans users from posting content that infringes anyone else’s intellectual property, it also states that copyright does not extend to underlying ideas: “For example, a person may own the copyright to a film, but not the underlying plot or themes that are expressed in the film.” With Instagram, the platform encourages creators to post original content, but in practice plagiarism and infringement often go unnoticed unless a creator spots and reports it themselves. YouTube, at least, has built-in systems that can scan videos and let rights holders set the rules, but there is little to protect smaller creators whose ideas are stolen, or when work is lifted from across the internet. Platforms thrive on mimicry. Originality is rare. So much so that when someone creates something new, it’s often copied by thousands of others in a matter of hours, with little or no credit given to the original creator. The media critic and gaming YouTuber Harry Brewis, also known as Hbomberguy , made a video on plagiarism in 2023 which became a surprise hit (it has clocked up some 38m views to date). He gave 17 examples where YouTube creators had stolen words, content and ideas from smaller creators or online forums, observing that “plagiarists seem to have this belief that they are better than their targets…: ‘Your ideas are wasted on you. They’d be much better served in my videos.’” Aspiring creators need content to help them gain followers, and established creators reliant on advertising revenue need to churn out content at pace. Any work, be it a piece of writing or a video, requires time and effort, but the incentive is to make a lot of work, quickly. In theory, audiences prize originality and fresh, exciting content – but for creators who post every day, publishing new content so often is unrealistic, leading some to copy and imitate others. The line between inspiration and theft can easily become blurred. An original idea trends when people are able to take a concept and make it their own, allowing memes and in-jokes to develop. Once enough people replicate an idea, it transforms into a trend and the source often disappears entirely. Take, for example, the Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday trend, which has inspired some 2.9m videos. Creators have taken the sound from the Jet2holidays advert and overlaid it on clips of things going spectacularly wrong – a tent catching fire, someone flying off a boat – turning the original ad into something entirely new. The flip side of this is that once an idea exists online, it’s regarded as fair game to copy without credit. My video went viral, with thousands of users in the comments supporting me and debating online plagiarism. My story then gained another life. Other creators posted “drama” and explainer videos of the situation I had already outlined in my video. I was delighted to see the situation sparking a wider debate, but I couldn’t help but be sceptical of their motivations. Were the people now weighing in on the story doing so to shed light on plagiarism or to chase views? At its best the internet can be a space where people share stories and ideas, and where creativity inspires more creativity. Giving credit is non negotiable. It creates a positive cycle where new ideas build on old ones, and where the time and effort someone has put into their work is recognised. In giving credit where it’s due, creators may feel incentivised to create rather than race to produce quick shareable content in the fear that their work might be stolen. Originality deserves celebration – and not to be reduced to simply content mined for virality.

    "essence": "Wolves reject £55m Newcastle bid for Strand Larsen Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Striker Jorgen Strand Larsen came off the bench to score twice against West Ham Nick Mashiter Football reporter Published 1 hour ago 298 Comments Ciaran Kelly Football reporter Wolves have rejected a second Newcastle bid for striker Jorgen Strand Larsen, who scored twice in the win over West Ham on Tuesday. The Magpies had returned with a £55m offer after a £50m approach was turned down earlier this week. Wolves do not want to sell the Norway international, firstly because of how little time they would have to find a replacement, with the transfer window closing on Monday, and also because of how valuable Strand Larsen is to their Premier League survival chances. Newcastle are looking for fresh firepower with Alexander Isak trying to engineer a move to Liverpool - the Sweden forward is in a stand-off with the Magpies and yet to play this season. Strand Larsen, who only made his loan move from Celta Vigo permanent for £23m this summer, came off the bench to score twice in the final eight minutes as Wolves beat West Ham 3-2 in the EFL Cup on Tuesday. Afterwards, boss Vitor Pereira refused to rule out a sale, even though he wants to keep the forward. He said: \"Football is football and every player has a price, even [Lionel] Messi or Cristiano [Ronaldo]. I understand football but for me it's very important for us. We will see what happens. \"If it's my decision, of course [he stays]. He is a very important player.\" Newcastle is an attractive option for Strand Larsen, who scored 14 Premier League goals last season, but he has remained professional and Pereira believes the 25-year-old will not force a move. He said: \"I know a lot of players in my career in this situation and they have asked me not to play but he wants to play every time. He wants to help the team. \"In the last seven or eight months I am with him, I know him very well. He will never force. Of course we know football is football. You must be ready for everything but I want to keep the best players and this kind of player with us.\" When is enough enough for Newcastle? Nick Mashiter Football reporter There was always going to be collateral damage from Isak's stance at Newcastle and Wolves are feeling that now. As the striker tries to force a move to Liverpool, the Magpies are still scrambling in the last few days of the transfer window. They have been interested in Porto's Samu Aghehowa but have so far balked at the £60m price tag for a 21-year-old who scored 27 times last season. A move for Brentford's Yoane Wissa is yet to come off, with the Bees rejecting two bids - the most recent being £40m for last season's 19-goal forward. Like Brentford, Wolves have shown resistance in the face of big money after two bids for Strand Larsen and they do not want to sell the 25-year-old. There is little time in the window to replace the Norway international, especially when Wolves are still looking at bringing in other strikers to support him. He is their most potent weapon and survival is naturally worth more than the current transfer bids. Losing him would put Wolves' top-flight status in jeopardy. His return of 14 goals in 30 Premier League starts during a debut season in England on loan from Celta Vigo helped Wolves survive after Vitor Pereira's December arrival. Yet Newcastle's desperation could see them throw good money after bad. Strand Larsen is a good player but - having joined permanently from Celta for £23m this summer - is he £60m-plus good? The question is, when do the Magpies decide it is too much or do circumstances dictate they need him whatever the cost?

    "essence": "Denmark summons top US diplomat over alleged Greenland influence operation 1 hour ago Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Share Save Getty Images A German navy ship pictured docking in Greenland - an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark Denmark's foreign minister has summoned the top US diplomat in Copenhagen, following a report that American citizens have been conducting covert operations in Greenland. Denmark's public broadcaster DR quoted sources as saying the aim was to infiltrate Greenland's society and promote its secession from Denmark to the US, although it was unable to clarify who the men were working for. Danish intelligence warned Greenland was being targeted by \"various kinds of influence campaigns\". Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said \"any attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the Kingdom [of Denmark] will of course be unacceptable\", and the US charge d'affaires had been summoned in that light. The BBC has approached the US embassy for comment. However, US President Trump has said several times he wants to annex Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Vice-President JD Vance has accused Copenhagen of underinvesting in the territory. On a visit to Greenland a few months ago, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned the US that \"you cannot annex another country\". Denmark's foreign minister said in a statement to the BBC that the government was \"aware that foreign actors continue to show an interest in Greenland and its position in the Kingdom of Denmark\". \"It is therefore not surprising if we experience outside attempts to influence the future of the Kingdom in the time ahead,\" he added. Denmark is a member of Nato and the European Union and has long seen the US as one of its closest allies, and Danes have been shocked by Trump's determination to control its semi-autonomous territory. The US president said this year he would not rule out seizing it by force. Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think? Denmark's PET security and intelligence service said in its assessment that influence campaigns would aim to \"create discord in the relationship between Denmark and Greenland\". This could be done by exploiting \"existing or invented disagreements\" either with \"traditional, physical influence agents or via disinformation\", it added. PET said it had strengthened its presence in Greenland and co-operation with its authorities. The US currently has no ambassador in Copenhagen, so Rasmussen has summoned Mark Stroh, who as charge d'affaires is the most senior diplomat in the Danish capital. Lars Lokke Rasmussen has already summoned the US charge d'affaires in Denmark this year in response to a separate report in May suggesting US spy agencies had been told to focus their efforts on Greenland. DR's report on Wednesday gave details of a visit by one American to Greenland's capital Nuuk, saying he was seeking to compile a list of Greenlanders who backed US attempts to take over the island. The aim would be to try to recruit them for a secession movement, DR said. The earlier May report in the Wall Street Journal also referred to learning more about Greenland's independence movement, as well as attitudes to American mineral extraction. At the time, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard did not deny the report but accused the Journal of \"breaking the law and undermining our nation's security and democracy\".

    "essence": "Taylor's engaged - what we learned and the new details revealed by Travis's dad 1 hour ago Share Save André Rhoden-Paul & Francesca Gillett BBC News Share Save Watch: \"Please give me an invite\" - Young Americans react to Taylor Swift's engagement \"Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.\" With that one-line, five-picture Instagram post, signed off with a fire cracker emoji, Taylor Swift announced her engagement to American football player Travis Kelce, sending the internet into a frenzy. Tuesday's post by the couple - who have been together for two years - has been liked more than 18 million times on the social media platform. NFL star Kelce is pictured getting down on one knee to pop the question to the world-famous music superstar, with the pair gazing into each other's eyes and embracing. In the third picture in the carousel, Swift, wearing a Ralph Lauren halter neck dress and diamond encrusted Cartier watch, flashes her engagement ring - a cushion cut diamond on a gold band. @TaylorSwift/Instagram According to US reports, the ring was purchased from Artifex Fine Jewelery. Prices for rings on its website start at around $29,000 (£21,506.26). Photos show the couple surrounded by roses, anemones, delphiniums and hydrangeas which appear to be set up in woodland with strategically placed urns and an archway, wedding florist Nicola Paul told the BBC. \"It's simple elegance, not too ostentatious,\" she said. \"It's been staged in the woods, so you get that lush greenery look.\" Celebrity florist Jeff Leatham, who has worked with the Kardashians, described the design as \"beautiful, hidden secret garden with a romantic mix of florals\". Neither Swift nor Kelce have been publicly engaged to anyone before. 'Feel so high school' Accompanying the Instagram post is Swift's ballad So High School from the Tortured Poets Department album - rumoured to have been written about Kelce. \"I feel so high school every time I look at you,\" she sings. The clip of the song finishes on the line \"Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me?\" which apparently is a reference to a 2016 interview in which Kelce chose to kiss Taylor in a game of Kiss, Marry, Kill. \"That was so magical and special to see,\" said Dr Iona Murphy, an adviser on last year's Victoria and Albert Museum's exhibition on Swift and a superfan who has written about Swift. \"A song that was written about Travis was now being used on the post. It's a nice full circle moment,\" said Dr Murphy, an English literature lecturer at Huddersfield University. She said the caption to the Instagram announcement - \"your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married\" – is also notable, as it refers to how the fans like to describe the couple. \"That's like a little joke in the fandom. You see it on social media. So it's like that was a little nod to the fans,\" she said. In an interview with ABC's News 5 Cleveland station, Kelce's father, Ed, revealed that \"Travis actually did the proposal... maybe two weeks, not quite two weeks ago\". He said this happened at a garden in the city of Lee's Summit, Missouri. \"He got her out there, they were about to go out to dinner, and he said, 'let's go out and have a glass of wine'... they got out there, and that's when he asked her, and it was beautiful,\" Ed Kelce said. \"They started FaceTiming me and their mother and her folks to make sure everybody knew. So, to see them together is great.\" @TaylorSwift/Instragram Fans scream in shock The pop emergency has resonated with fans in an extraordinary way. Videos on social media show groups of friends screaming as they heard the news, while others describe feeling emotional and even teary. \"I thought it was AI when I first opened up Instagram,\" Chloe, who runs a Swiftie news fan account with 74,000 followers on TikTok, told the BBC. \"I couldn't believe it was real, then I realised it was their accounts that posted it,\" she said. \"I immediately freaked out and text my group chat incoherently. Just excitement and disbelief, really.\" As the news broke, many Swift fans were joking on social media that they were happy for their \"close friend\" Swift. Swift recognised early on in her career the benefit of connecting with fans, and has carefully crafted a sense of relatability. And at the same time, many of Swift's original fans - who were teenagers at the same time as Swift was breaking through as an artist - have grown up with her, and are now at the same age when they may also be getting engaged or married. Explaining why she felt so strongly about the engagement, Chloe said: \"I feel in a way we all know her. \"Her music is so personal, and the way she connects to her fans is through the way she talks and sings about her relationships. I just want the best for her and just happy she's found love.\" EPA The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, were among the millions of fans who liked the engagement post on Instagram. US President Donald Trump also joined in the fun. \"I wish them a lot of luck. I think he's a great player, and he's a great guy, and I think she's a terrific person,\" he said. Only last year, Trump wrote on social media \"I hate Taylor Swift!\", after the singer endorsed his presidential rival Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay published a photo of himself congratulating Kelce after the Kansas City Chiefs won the NFL championship in 2023. The caption on his Instagram post reads: \"From one ring to the next…congrats @killatrav & @taylorswift ! From your favourite Home Ec Teacher Gx\". Allow Instagram content?

Accept and continue And reacting to one comment suggesting that he himself should now \"cater the wedding\", Ramsay replied \"I'm bready for it.\" Fascination with Swift's love life The social media frenzy about Swift's engagement news marks yet another high point in the fans' huge interest and fascination in her love life - including her past relationships and heartbreaks. Indeed, Swift has previously spoken about the media's \"fixation on painting me as the psycho serial dater girl\". But it is also something the songwriter has deliberately played into by famously writing about her exes in her song and giving clues to fans about her relationships. According to Laura Snapes, the Guardian's deputy music editor and a Swift fan, it was \"almost like an artform\" how she has played into the media speculation around her love life. \"She definitely knows the benefits of a relationship to keep her in the headlines. 1989 is about her relationship with Harry Styles but as far as we can tell that lasted a matter of months\", Snapes said on the Today In Focus podcast in 2023. And interestingly, the engagement announcement came just weeks after Swift's interview with Kelce on his New Heights podcast - which Dr Murphy believed was noteworthy as it was the first time fans saw them interact together in a long interview and how compatible they seemed. \"It was almost like a two-hour interview - we haven't had that much interview content. So it was lovely to watch. We could see the chemistry and how comfortable she felt with him,\" she said. It's not just Swift saying yes - the feeling is the same for her fandom, according to Chloe. \"We Swifties have seen a lot of boyfriends over the years, some we've liked and some we definitely have not liked. \"Travis is someone who loves her proudly and doesn't seem intimidated by her success which other suitors might have been,\" she said.

    "essence": "Police killed in Australia shooting named as manhunt continues 2 hours ago Share Save Ottilie Mitchell and Tiffanie Turnbull BBC News, Sydney Share Save Victoria Police Senior Constable Vadim De Waart and Detective Neal Thompson have been named as the officers killed Two police officers who were shot dead while on duty in a rural Australian town have been named, as a massive search continues for their alleged killer. Victoria Police identified the victims as 59-year-old Detective Neal Thompson - a local officer on the brink of retirement - and 35-year-old Senior Constable Vadim De Waart. The pair had travelled to the property in Porepunkah, north-east of Melbourne, alongside eight colleagues to execute a warrant for alleged sexual offences. Another officer was seriously injured in the shootout but is recovering after surgery. Police say the suspect - named as local man Dezi Freeman, 56 - is heavily armed and \"still at large\" more than 24 hours on. Thompson joined the force in 1987 and worked with the major fraud and crime squads before moving to the town of Wangaratta - an hour from Porepunkah - in 2007. A great lover of the outdoors, he was planning for his imminent retirement. De Waart was temporarily posted to Wangarratta, but lived in Melbourne, where the avid traveller had moved from Belgium. In a statement, Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Mike Bush said the \"devastating loss\" of the two officers \"struck at the heart\" of both the broader policing family and the Porepunkah community. \"It is not lost on me that our members take a risk every time they go to work to protect the Victorian community,\" he said. \"While we all live with the knowledge that the worst could happen on a shift, we don't expect it to.\" Who is Dezi Freeman, the 'sovereign citizen' wanted for killing police? Groups of officers, a helicopter and at least one armoured vehicle are combing the dense bushland where Mr Freeman absconded - a task locals have likened to finding \"a needle in a haystack\" - with authorities warning residents to stay inside until he is caught. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Bush said police were \"pouring every resource\" into the search for Mr Freeman, urging people in the Porepunkah area to \"be vigilant\" and keep safe. He also confirmed that Mr Freeman's partner and children were safe, refuting previous media reports that he had taken his family hostage. Nine/A Current Affair Dezi Freeman gave an interview to A Current Affair in 2018 complaining about his neighbours Since the shooting there have been no sightings of Mr Freeman, who reportedly knows the local wilderness well, but authorities are focusing their efforts on bush near his home. \"He will know that area better than us so that is why we are putting in every expert, supported by local knowledge,\" Mr Bush said. Surrounded by heavily wooded hills in the Australian Alps, Porepunkah is only about an hour's drive from the New South Wales border, and Mr Bush said he couldn't rule out the possibility Mr Freeman may have left the state - though there was currently \"no information\" to suggest that. Misty-Rose Wilson, a local business operator, told the BBC those looking for Mr Freeman would be battling very thick bush and a very steep incline, along with dismal weather conditions and low visibility. \"Knowing how hard it would be to track through that area, it's a bit of a needle in a haystack to be quite honest,\" she said. Marcus Simpson, who manages operations at the local airfield, said the town was in shock after the shooting. \"It's a good community, tight-knit, and everyone sort of knows most people,\" he said. \"[The town] is going to need a bit of a big healing process to get over it.\" Mr Freeman has previously described himself as a \"sovereign citizen\", referring to a person that falsely believes they aren't subject to Australian laws and government authority. His hatred of authority has been well documented in online posts, videos and court documents . Police have said it is too early to answer questions about Mr Freeman's beliefs - but the incident has revived questions over how authorities deal with extremists views. Some, including Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, have noted the similarities between this attack and a shocking 2022 ambush on police in Queensland . \"This threat is very real and we need to be very vigilant about it,\" he said in an interview with the ABC on Tuesday night.

    "essence": "Energy bills to rise by more than expected ahead of winter 3 hours ago Share Save Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent, BBC News Share Save Getty Images Gas and electricity prices will rise by 2% for millions of households under the latest cap announced by energy regulator Ofgem. The increase, which is slightly more than analysts expected, means a household using a typical amount of energy will pay £1,755 a year, up £35 a year on the current cap. The increase will kick in at the start of October, which campaigners say will mean another winter of relatively high energy bills. Ofgem's cap sets the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity for millions of households in England, Scotland and Wales. Individual households can calculate their estimated specific change by adding £2 onto every £100 they spend at the moment on energy each year. The increase comes as families are also facing rises in other basic costs. The British Retail Consortium said that food costs were rising at their fastest rate since the February of last year , with the price of chocolate, butter and eggs soaring. The energy cap sets the maximum price for each unit, but not the total bill which depends on how much energy you use. The change comes into force at the start of October and lasts for three months. Ofgem changes the cap, largely based on the cost of energy on wholesale markets. However, the rise in bills this time is partly the result of the higher than expected cost of balancing the energy network and extra support measures for consumers, previously announced by the government and in place this winter. Anyone on means-tested benefits will automatically receive the £150 Warm Home Discount on their bills. Some previously did not qualify owing to the size of their property, but that condition will be scrapped. All billpayers will chip in to fund this extra support, mainly through higher standing charges - the fixed cost of connecting to the supply. It means standing charges will typically rise by 4% for electricity and 14% for gas, with the latter rising from 29p a day to 34p. Energy price cap: How much gas and electricity does a typical household use? The winter fuel payment U-turn in numbers 'Healthier market' The consumer group Which? said it could be a good time to shop around for a fixed-price deal, but billpayers should be alert to exit fees. \"Some contracts charge large fees to leave early, which would cancel out any savings,\" said Emily Seymour, from Which?. Ofgem said that more than a third of billpayers were now on fixed deals, where the price of each unit is fixed for a year and unaffected by the price cap. Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at the energy regulator, said this was a sign of a \"healthier market\". He accepted that people would still feel the impact of a price rise, but added some could do things to save themselves money, such as paying via direct debit each month rather than receiving a bill every three months - called standard credit. Around 20 million households pay by direct debit, with eight million on standard credit, and six million on prepayment meters. Leanne Gough says it is hard for people to come to ask for help Campaigners say many households are still struggling to pay bills, as well as repay £4bn of energy debt that built up during a period of high prices. Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said this would mean another winter of high prices. \"The average family still paying hundreds of pounds more than they did just a few years ago,\" he said. Some support comes from local communities. Staff at Parc Primary School at Cwm Parc in the Rhondda Valley provide extensive help for families struggling with everyday costs, including their energy bills. The school is partnered with the Fuel Bank Foundation charity, providing vouchers to low-income families to meet energy costs. \"We've got a high level of need, and over the last couple of years we've seen that more and more. People are really struggling. And not only with the fuel, but life in general,\" said Leanne Gough, the school's family engagement officer. \"Sometimes you issue a fuel bank voucher and you can see the relief on their face, but it is a short-term. People are proud, so it takes a lot for them to come to ask. They will do everything they can beforehand.\" The government, which earlier this year made a U-turn on winter fuel payments , said it was determined to help vulnerable families by expanding the Warm Home Discount. Energy minister Michael Shanks said the government wanted more clean energy produced domestically to bring down prices. Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said the Warm Home Discount expansion should only be a temporary measure and targeting those most in need was a better long-term requirement. The Conservatives said that energy bills were going up owing to government ministers' choices, rather than wholesale costs. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said \"the last thing\" families and pensioners needed was higher energy bills this winter.

    "essence": "Former player makes AFL history by coming out as bisexual 3 hours ago Share Save Yang Tian BBC News Reporting from Sydney Share Save Getty Images Brown described a culture of \"hyper-masculinity\" in the AFL A former Aussie Rules player has come out as the first openly gay or bisexual man in the Australian Football League's (AFL) 129-year history. Mitch Brown, who played 94 matches for the West Coast Eagles from between 2007 and 2016, told The Daily Aus that the weight of hiding his sexuality played a \"huge\" part in his decision to retire. He added that he hopes his decision to speak out will create the \"safety, comfort and space\" for others to come forward. The news marks a pivotal moment for the AFL, which before Brown's announcement, was the only major professional men's sport globally to never have had an openly gay or bisexual player, even after retirement. Brown first shared the news in a direct message to The Daily Aus's social media account after watching coverage of recent incidents of homophobia in the AFL. \"I played in the AFL for 10 years for the West Coast Eagles, and I'm a bisexual man,\" he wrote. The decision to speak out came from a \"feeling of peace... comfort and confidence\" that he didn't have while hiding his sexuality when he was an active player, Brown said. \"It was never once an opportunity to speak openly or explore your feelings or questions in a safe way,\" he added. Brown described a culture of \"hyper-masculinity\" in the AFL, where he heard \"countless\" homophobic comments hurled at him on the field. \"When I was growing up at school, the word 'gay' was thrown around constantly… For a man in Australia, [it was seen as] probably the weakest thing you could be.\" He also recalled having a conversation with teammates about how they would feel having to shower next to a gay man. \"One of the players said 'I'd rather be in a cage full of lions than have a shower next to a gay man.'\" Brown's revelation and criticism of the AFL's culture could mark a significant shift in the locker rooms of Australian men's sports, an expert in behavioural science told the BBC. \"This is an historic moment for world sport because the AFL is the last major professional sport to be without a openly gay or bisexual male player. However players coming out so far hasn't had much of an effect on changing behaviours in the grassroots,\" said Monash University researcher Erik Denison. \"[But] Brown is taking a very different approach than other players in that he is being very open about the problems that need to change in his sport, at the grassroots, to make people like him feel safe.\" It has been 50 years since former American football player David Kopay came out as the first gay professional athlete in the NFL - but Denison is hopeful that Brown's announcement will \"help drive change to culture and behaviour at clubs around Australia\". Brown, 36, is currently in a relationship with a female partner and was previously married to former netball player Shae Bolton, with whom he shares two sons. The announcement comes after several high-profile homophobic incidents in the AFL. Last week, Adelaide Crows player Izak Rankine received a four-week ban for using a \"highly offensive\" homophobic slur during a game. Addressing the incident, Brown said he would like to see a \"sense of change\" in the league through the lifting up of \"positive male role models\". \"My advice to the AFL would be, let's celebrate the players who may not be the most successful, but they're the most important players in our community.\" Brown said he believes there are currently gay and bisexual players in the AFL who remain closeted. He encouraged fans to have empathy for all players and shared a message for those who still don't feel comfortable enough to speak out. \"I see you and you are not alone.\" Pride jersey row: A reckoning for Australian sport?

    "essence": "Where does blame lie for Celtic's Champions League exit? Image source, SNS Image caption, Brendan Rodgers left big-money signings Arne Engels and Adam Idah on the bench in Almaty Tom English BBC Scotland's chief sports writer Published 4 hours ago Now that Celtic's doomsday scenario has come true - ignominy in Almaty - there should be a reappraisal of the club's most egregious and self-inflicted exits in Champions League qualifiers in the last dozen seasons or so. Maribor, Malmo and AEK Athens. CFR Cluj, Ferencvaros and FC Midtjylland. All wounding, all the cause of introspection and fury. Some of those clubs had a big claim on being the greatest European bogey that caused the most damage to Celtic and the delusions of grandeur they have of themselves as a great European club. The immortals of 1967 and the atmosphere on Champions League nights continue to do some seriously heavy lifting on that front. All of those Celtic conquerors were emphatically put in their place by Kairat Almaty on Tuesday night. Brendan Rodgers has overseen some horror shows - seven-goal thrashings that made you hide behind the couch - but this was on another level. It was third-rate stuff, with apologies to third-rate. How did Celtic let Champions League dream slip? Published 13 hours ago Celtic blow Champions League bid in Almaty shootout Sportsound: Celtic crash out of the Champions League play-off Take those exits from the Champions League, multiply them by Rodgers' wretched defeats by Barcelona, Paris St-Germain, Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund and still you do not hit the cringe factor of these ties against a Kairat side that a properly functioning Celtic would expect to beat. No goal in 210 minutes of football, three missed penalties in the shootout and a couple of golden chances wasted across the two legs led to more than £40m wafting away in the air in Kazakhstan. And, of course, the Champions League being swapped for the Europa League. As failings go, this was a seismic one and in analysing who is at fault, there is a world of criticism for everybody. This was a defeat for the collective - players, manager, board. They are all in the frame together. It was an illustration of a club gambling on progress by waiting for Champions League qualification to be secured before properly refreshing its squad. It is a thunderous example of how they have allowed their standards to drop, on the pitch and off it. Not that many months ago, Celtic went toe-to-toe over two legs with the Bayern Munich of Manuel Neuer, Dayot Upamecano, Joshua Kimmich, Jamal Musiala, Harry Kane, Kingsley Coman and Thomas Muller. In losing 3-2 on aggregate and coming within seconds of taking the Germans to extra time in their own backyard, Celtic had momentum, something to build on. They also had a stack of money in the bank and a support, broadly, facing in the same direction as the board. There was relative harmony and positivity. A rare commodity in Glasgow. Now there's bitterness and rancour. They have blown their feel-good factor sky high. 'Holes in the Celtic team obvious' In two games the lack of ambition to improve the team has boomeranged back and hit the club squarely between the eyes. That is on the board of directors - chief among them, major shareholder Dermot Desmond. The Irishman is immensely powerful at the club. Would it be too much for the fans to hope to hear from him from time to time? Could chief executive Michael Nicholson give a little insight on the vision? It would not hurt and it might help explain how they have gone from the optimism of Bayern Munich to the humiliation of Kairat Almaty in six months. The holes in the team have been obvious for a while. The need for new energy was clear. Somehow, Celtic entered the Champions League play-off round comprehensively weaker than last season. Tuesday's failure is also on Rodgers. Celtic get love-bombed at home. Rodgers over-praises his team when they beat up on some domestic sides with a tiny fraction of their budget. Everybody swoons when they put four and five on weaker teams. When they do a job on Rangers and win another league title to sit alongside all the other league titles, there is a feeling that nothing else matters. Progress in Europe? Yeah, that would be nice. But keeping the Ibrox club in their box is the bread and butter. It's about ambition and the board's interpretation of what ambition looks like. Celtic should be way, way beyond such parochial thinking. The allegation can be levelled at them, fairly or unfairly, of just wanting to stay a few steps ahead of their city rival. Occasionally, at Rodgers' pleading, they'll push the boat out - Arne Engels, Adam Idah, Auston Trusty brought in at a cost of about £26m - but mostly it is steady as she goes. And it has worked if domestic dominance, player trading and money in the coffers is your ideal. If trying to kick on from Bayern is more your bag - as is the case with Rodgers - then there is a problem. But Rodgers gets no free pass in all of this. To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. This video can not be played Media caption, Brendan Rodgers said Celtic have to stick together after the loss to Kairat This is the flip-side of the argument. So many players from last season have gone backwards. Idah and Engels cannot even get in the team. Trusty would not have been in the team either had he been fit. These are Rodgers' signings. The core of the team is still Ange Postecoglou's, because too many of the players Rodgers has recruited haven't done it as yet. So, this exit is everybody's shambles. The leading narrative might be about the board not signing the players for the big push, but the board, if they were minded, could come back with a counter-argument about the value for money Rodgers' arrivals have provided so far. If he's not starting them, the answer right now is \"not much\". It would not be unreasonable for them to say that they expected more. A win over Kairat or a goal or a semblance of cohesion over two legs. There is no contract offer on the table for the manager and so, as it stands, he is away next summer. Maybe that outcome would suit both parties. Rodgers says there is no conflict between him and his board but his frustration has been obvious. This is a knotted situation that could become even worse domestically if Rangers were not so hell-bent on raising the ante in the crisis stakes. Celtic will likely win one, two and very possibly three trophies this season. If they do, the regrettable thing is that the lessons of Almaty could be lost. The Old Firm are now in a ferocious battle with each other to determine who has the angriest fans. It is a colossal fight. Rangers have to play Brugge on Wednesday evening, already trailing 3-1 with the likelihood of more pain to come in Belgium. Then the Glasgow Two meet at Ibrox on Sunday. Oxygen masks may be required.

    "essence": "Ukraine admits Russia has entered key region of Dnipropetrovsk 5 hours ago Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Share Save Russian ministry of defence Russia's defence ministry released an image claiming to show Russian troops inside the village of Zaporizke, but Ukraine says it is still in control there Ukrainian forces have acknowledged that Russia's military has crossed into the eastern industrial region of Dnipropetrovsk and is trying to establish a foothold. \"This is the first attack of such a large scale in Dnipropetrovsk region,\" Viktor Trehubov, of the Dnipro Operational-Strategic Group of Troops told the BBC, although he made clear their advance had been stopped. Russia has claimed throughout the summer that it has entered the area, as its forces try to push deeper into Ukrainian territory from the Donetsk region. In early June, Russian officials said an offensive had begun in Dnipropetrovsk, although the latest Ukrainian reports suggest they have barely breached the regional border. Any Russian advance into Dnipropetrovsk would be a blow to Ukrainian morale, as a US-led diplomatic bid to bring the war to an end appears to be flagging despite President Donald Trump meeting Russia's Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The Ukrainian DeepState mapping project assessed on Tuesday that Russia had now occupied two villages just inside the region, Zaporizke and Novohryhorivka. However, Ukraine's armed forces general staff denied that was the case. The military \"continue to control\" Zaporizke, it said in a statement, and \"active hostilities are also ongoing in the area of the village of Novohryhorivka\". Moscow has not laid claim to Dnipropetrovsk, unlike Donetsk and Ukraine's four other eastern regions, but it has attacked its big cities, including the regional capital Dnipro. An attack overnight into Wednesday also targeted the energy sector in the neighbouring region of Poltava. Before the war Dnipropetrovsk had a population of more than three million and was Ukraine's second biggest centre of heavy industry after the Donbas, which is made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Although Russian forces have made slow progress in capturing territory and have suffered very high casualties, they have made recent gains in Donetsk. A small infantry group made a sudden 10km (six mile) push beyond Ukraine's defensive lines near Dobropillia earlier this month, but latest indications suggest their advance has been halted. Watch: BBC takes part in Dobropillya evacuation as bombs fall Putin is reported to have told Trump he would be willing to end the war if Ukraine handed over the areas of Donetsk region it still controls, but many Ukrainians believe Russia's leader has other plans. Col Pavlo Palisa, deputy head of the presidential office in Kyiv, warned reporters in the US in June that the Kremlin wanted to occupy all of Ukraine east of the Dnipro river, which cuts Ukraine in half. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, also warned that handing Ukrainian territory to Russia as part of a peace deal was \"a trap\". \"We are forgetting that Russia has not made one single concession and they are the ones who are the aggressor here,\" she told the BBC. After meeting Putin in Alaska and then Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington, Trump said last week he had begun arrangements for a summit between the two leaders. By the end of last week hopes of a breakthrough had dimmed. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted the \"agenda [for a summit] is not ready at all\" and no meeting was planned. He also said any discussion on future security guarantees without Russian involvement was \"pointless\", even though that would be a non-starter for the West. Late on Tuesday, US envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News he would meet Ukrainian officials in New York later this week and that \"we talk to the Russians every day\". President Zelensky has meanwhile urged his Western allies to intensify efforts aimed at agreeing future security guarantees in the event of a deal. He met the head of Britain's armed forces, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, in Kyiv on Tuesday and the UK prime minister's spokesman said the UK would be ready to put troops on the ground once hostilities had ended. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Tuesday that security guarantees for Ukraine would first and foremost enable the Ukrainian army to defend their country in the long term. Merz said Zelensky had made clear he was ready to sit down with Putin and now it was Moscow's turn: \"If the Russian president is serious about putting an end to the killing, then he'll accept the offer.\" Ukraine meanwhile has announced that men aged 18 to 22 can travel abroad, in an easing of a law that has required all up to the age of 60 to gain authorisation. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said the change also included those currently in other countries - meaning they could now return to Ukraine and leave again if they wished. A growing number of Ukrainian parents are sending teenage boys abroad before they reach 18. \"We want Ukrainians to maintain their links with Ukraine as much as possible,\" Svyrydenko said. Men aged 18 to 22 are not subject to military conscription, which has a minimum age of 25 after it was lowered last year. An estimated 5.6 million Ukrainian men currently live abroad.

    "essence": "In decline or in transition? Hamilton's Ferrari start analysed Image source, PA Media Image caption, Lewis Hamilton has won two grands prix, plus this year's sprint race in China, since the start of the 2022 season Andrew Benson F1 Correspondent Published 5 hours ago 259 Comments Lewis Hamilton left the last race of the first part of the Formula 1 season saying he was looking forward to a break - and acting like he needed one. For the most successful driver in the history, it has not been an easy first 14 races with Ferrari. The season started with Hamilton full of positivity about his new environment, and a sprint race pole and victory at the second race of the season in China hinted at great promise. But reality bit back hard within 24 hours of that success. Both Ferraris were disqualified from the grand prix in Shanghai for technical infringements, having not been on the pace of the McLarens. Since then, Hamilton and Ferrari have struggled for competitiveness, and Hamilton ended the first part of the season saying at the Hungarian Grand Prix that he was \"just useless\" and \"drove terribly\". So what has not been working for Hamilton at Ferrari? A part-season of two halves The raw statistics of Hamilton's first part-season offer no firm conclusions. The Briton has been out-qualified by Leclerc 12-5 across all qualifying sessions, where a fair comparison can be made, and is on average 0.146 seconds slower. But the season can be split into two parts - before and after the Miami Grand Prix, the sixth race of the season. Over the first six races, Hamilton was on average 0.204secs slower than Leclerc, and he qualified ahead only twice - in both sessions in China. Since the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix in mid-May, Hamilton's average deficit to Leclerc is just 0.078secs, including his two recent difficult weekends in Belgium and Hungary. In the run up to those two events, Hamilton had out-qualified Leclerc three times in four races. Most drivers who have switched teams in F1 in recent years have faced some kind of adaption period, and Hamilton's relationship with his engineer Riccardo Adami still does not sound at the level of mutual understanding he enjoyed with Peter Bonnington at Mercedes. On top of that, Leclerc has been racing for Ferrari since 2019, and is regarded by many as perhaps the fastest driver in F1 over one lap. Can any driver be said to have \"lost it\" - as some have started to ask about Hamilton - if they are 0.078secs slower than arguably the fastest driver in the world? Of course not. Negative trends But there are some trends about Hamilton's form in the past few years. In his first two seasons as team-mate to George Russell at Mercedes, they were separated by hundredths of a second on average qualifying pace, in 2022 in Hamilton's favour, in 2023 in Russell's. Last year, though, something happened. Russell thrashed Hamilton 18-5 in qualifying at an average advantage of 0.171secs. Hamilton consoled himself with the fact that he had told Mercedes he was leaving for Ferrari before the season had even started, so the year was always going to be difficult. Even so, the remarks Hamilton made in Hungary this year were reminiscent of those he occasionally made in 2024, such as when he said at the penultimate race in Qatar that he was \"definitely not fast any more\". It's common for Hamilton to react in an emotional way when he cannot explain why he's not as quick as he expects; somewhere along the way, he has lost confidence, and is questioning himself. Why the focus on qualifying? Firstly, it provides a reference for absolute speed. Beyond that, not only has Hamilton always prided himself on his qualifying, but he is also the all-time record pole winner by far more than he is the race record holder. He has 105 wins to Michael Schumacher's 91, but 104 poles to Schumacher's 68. And until losing the qualifying battle to Russell over their three years together, no driver had ever come out on top against Hamilton over their time as team-mates. The only person who even got close was Fernando Alonso, who was just 0.003secs off him in 2007. And, like Hamilton, he is an all-time great. The design philosophy problem Late braking and gaining time in the corner-entry phase has been Hamilton's stock-in-trade during his career. But he has made no secret of the fact that he does not particularly get on with the current generation of cars. Until 2021, F1 cars had flat floors, were higher at the rear than the front, and had softer suspension. Hamilton would use the rise in rear ride-height during braking, and the subsequent shift in aerodynamic balance that generated more front grip, to rotate the car. His ability to balance on the edge of adhesion in the braking-entry phase at a higher speed than almost anyone else made him stand out. The cars introduced in 2022 have shaped underbodies, using so-called venturi tunnels to generate downforce through ground effect. They have to run low and stiff to work at their best. Attacking corners in the way Hamilton did previously doesn't work. A different style is required. Drivers talk about needing to brake earlier and roll speed into the corner to best exploit the underbody downforce. Hamilton seems not to have been able to adapt as readily as others to this, or at least has not been able to differentiate himself as much. But why? Until the last few years, after all, he was renowned for his adaptability. Hamilton's specific problem with the Ferrari this year is that he is lacking confidence in the rear during braking and corner entry. Ferrari have introduced a series of upgrades in recent races - a new floor in Austria and in Belgium a new rear suspension, which seems to be limiting lift so the rear ride-height stays in a smaller window for a more optimum aerodynamic position. Leclerc said in Hungary that he now finds the car more predictable, so that on a qualifying lap he is able to \"play with the limit a bit more\". But so far this does not seem to have translated into the car speaking the same language as Hamilton, who was more than 0.2secs slower than Leclerc when he was knocked out of the second qualifying session in Hungary. When a car is not giving a driver the messages they want, they have to think harder when driving, so the speed does not flow as naturally. 'You can get run down' Hamilton turned 40 this year, so it is inevitable that people have started to question whether his relative struggles in the past couple of years are anything to do with age. The last driver to win a grand prix in his 40s was Nigel Mansell, who was 41 when he took the chequered flag in Australia in 1994 after Michael Schumacher had collided with Damon Hill while disputing the world title. Alain Prost was 39 when he won his last world title in 1993. Alonso would have won in Monaco in 2023, aged 41, had his Aston Martin team made the right tyre choice at a pit stop as rain was just starting to hit the circuit. Mansell, Prost and Alonso all had breaks before their final blast in F1 - Mansell went to IndyCar for a couple of years, Prost had an enforced sabbatical, and Alonso took two years off to explore other categories. Hamilton has been in F1 non-stop for 19 years. Four years ago he had to suffer the blow of missing out on a record eighth world title in the most controversial circumstances in Abu Dhabi, and he has not had a car competitive enough since to avenge what he regards as an injustice. And now he has to get up to speed with a new team, with a different culture, against a super-quick team-mate. Hill says: \"Lewis has been doing this his whole life, since he was a kid. Packing your bags, travelling, the jet lag. The 24-race season is really, really hard. \"You can get run down. The question is whether he can sit back and enjoy his time at Ferrari, take a bit of a break, and stop trying to change them. They bought him. They want him to succeed. \"Lewis is looking over at (NFL legend) Tom Brady and people who've inspired him, who kept competitive in their sports for a very long time and extended their careers. \"But there is a point where you burn yourself out. You haven't got any energy left. \"And then you can't clear your mind. You need a very clear mind to race and commit to what is needed. \"Lewis has always considered himself exceptional, which he is. But there are some things that you can't escape, which is the clock.\" Age is not a number Talking to ex-F1 drivers who have been through the process themselves, and have discussed it with other sportspeople who have done the same, the age that matters to an athlete is biological, not the number in their passport. People age in different ways - in body, mindset, vision, reactions, balance, precision - and at different times and speeds. The brain builds new synapses more slowly, so finds it harder to adjust. If Hamilton is hitting one or more of these limits, it would explain why he is struggling to adapt as well as he did in the past. Equally, a successful, experienced driver knows they achieved peak performance with certain ways of assessing and feeling the car. Once this is strongly imprinted in the brain, the older you are, the more difficult it is to change. If Hamilton has lost even a tiny edge in this way, it would make sense that in a car that has reasonably fast rear movements that are not predictable and progressive, his body and mind cannot cope, accept, adjust and improve as well as they once could. That would not mean Hamilton could not win again, but it could mean that he won't be as successful as he was unless he can find a car that better suits his driving style. The rules are changing next year, and cars are going back to flat, stepped bottoms, similar to the kind used before 2022. If those cars give Hamilton the cues he needs, and allow his inputs to more perfectly communicate with the outputs of the car, then he will still be able to win multiple races and championships, even if what is being seen now is a consequence of age. At the same time, ageing is a reality no one can escape. It's one Hill had to confront. In 1998, two years after becoming world champion, he took Jordan to their first victory, at the Belgian Grand Prix. But in 1999 he suddenly found he was no longer competitive. Hill says: \"How does age affect racing drivers? It's a bit like when you're on your holidays. Eventually, you know you're going to have to go home. And the last day of a holiday is really not a holiday at all, is it? \"As a sportsperson, you know there is an end. And that plays on your mind. There's no way you can ignore it. And it's a wrench and a weight to actually think of not doing this thing any more, especially if you love it, and you're good at it. \"But it's no fun doing it when you're not quick. It's no fun being in F1 when you're not winning, if you're expected to win. It is just a horrible, horrible experience. And what are you doing? You're hoping you find the magic solution.\" Related topics Formula 1 More on this story Would Red Bull be interested in an Albon return?

    "essence": "Fearnley overcomes nerves - and heckler - at US Open Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Jacob Fearnley has now won main-draw matches at all four Grand Slam tournaments Jonathan Jurejko BBC Sport tennis news reporter in New York Published 5 hours ago 148 Comments Britain's Jacob Fearnley overcame nerves in the big moments - and a heckler - to secure the first US Open main-draw win of his career. Fearnley, 24, struggled with his service game before coming through 7-5 6-2 5-7 6-4 in a late-night battle with Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut. A first-service percentage of below 50% across the opening three sets led to 16 double faults, before Fearnley cleaned up his opening shot in the fourth to help get over the line. \"If you look at when the double faults were happening – serving for the match, serving to stay in the set – they came at the highest tension moments,\" said Fearnley, who won in three hours and 24 minutes - the longest match of his career. \"Those ones are definitely down to nerves more than anything.\" The Scot was also put off by a rambunctious fan behind the baseline - who was initially loudly supporting him before switching to root for Bautista Agut. Gauff 'mentally exhausted' after US Open first-round win Published 8 hours ago Sinner makes dominant start to US Open defence Published 16 hours ago \"When I Iost the service game at 5-4 in the third he completely turned – I couldn't believe it,\" Fearnley said. \"I wanted to say something. He switched quick. It wasn't abuse, just confusing and extremely loud. He didn't say a nice thing after that.\" Fearnley was the only Briton to win at Flushing Meadows on Tuesday, with Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal, Francesca Jones and Billy Harris all going out. Now he is set for a rematch against German third seed Alexander Zverev in the second round on Thursday. Zverev, who has already swept Fearnley aside at the Australian Open and Miami Open this year, beat Chile's Alejandro Tabilo in his opening match. Another career milestone ticked off for Fearnley Fearnley's progress has been so rapid over the past 15 months, it can be easy to forget how inexperienced he remains at the highest level. Little over a year ago, the former US college student was ranked outside of the world's leading 500 players. Since then he has soared up the rankings - cracking the top 50 in June - after a stunning introduction to the ATP Tour. Fearnley has a habit of drawing high-profile names early in the Grand Slams and has already played on some of the iconic courts in the game. But in recent months his form has been compromised by a nervous tension which is particularly damaging to his serve. Asked how he can solve the issue, Fearnley said: \"I'm not too sure. I guess it's helpful to know that even hitting all those double faults I can win the match – that's a positive more than anything. \"There are good days and bad days, but in recent matches the doubles faults have been an issue. \"I'll be playing Zverev next on another big court - a high-stakes, high-tense environment and I think putting myself in those situations will help.\" With Fearnley and Bautista Agut not taking to the court until after 8pm local time, a long night looking inevitable when the British number three finally secured a 62-minute opener. When Fearnley used greater variety in the second and third sets - to move the world number 47 around - it reaped rewards. Fearnley closed in on a relatively sharpish straight-setter when he broke serve early in the third - only for more double faults to help 37-year-old Bautista Agut extend the contest. But he reset admirably in the fourth set, landing more first serves and limiting the double faults, to get over the line. Surviving the first round meant Fearnley has now completed a full set of victories at the four Grand Slam tournaments. \"It was an extremely tough match, I knew Roberto would make me go right to the end,\" said Fearnley, who wrapped up victory about 11:15pm local time.

    "essence": "'It's going to be controversial' - will US Ryder Cup captain Bradley pick himself? Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Bradley has made two playing appearances in the Ryder Cup and been on the losing side both times Iain Carter Golf correspondent Published 5 hours ago 307 Comments \"Ridiculous\" and \"controversial\" are two of the words Keegan Bradley is using to describe his predicament while he considers whether to pick himself for the US Ryder Cup team. There was always a good chance the 39-year-old would find himself in this deeply uncomfortable situation. He narrowly missed selection for the last Ryder Cup and, by common consent, is currently one of the top dozen American golfers. Bradley's appointment as captain came from left field. He is far from done as a player and he has only played two Ryder Cups, both defeats in 2012 at Medinah and two years later at Gleneagles. His kit bag from his 2012 debut remains unopened. He does not want to see those uniforms again until he has featured on a winning team. Passion for the American cause runs through his DNA, but whether his captaincy offers the US its best chance of winning back the trophy lost to Europe in Rome two years ago remains open to question. Bradley knows his six automatic qualifiers and given his playing performances, including June's victory over Tommy Fleetwood at the Travelers Championship, he is firmly in the conversation for one of the six wildcard picks. He will announce those at 16:00 BST on Wednesday, 27 August, a month out from the 45th staging of the biennial contest against Europe, whose captain Luke Donald will name his picks on 1 September. Who is in contention for Ryder Cup wildcard picks? Published 2 days ago Trump to attend Ryder Cup & backs Bradley to play Published 2 days ago Bradley would have been under consideration whoever was in charge, having finished 11th in the qualifying table. But he is the captain. And there has not been a playing skipper since Arnold Palmer 62 years ago, when the Ryder Cup was nowhere near the all-consuming sporting behemoth it has become. \"It's a really strange thing to kind of ponder,\" Bradley said at last week's Tour Championship. \"Making the picks and thinking of picking yourself is ridiculous, it doesn't seem like reality sometimes. \"We're going to do the best we can to make the right decision and it is going to be controversial to certain people either way. I'm prepared for that. \"I'm confident with whichever decision I make its for the betterment of the team and we'll see.\" Whether he makes the right call will be determined only by the final outcome of the match. For it to be deemed a success, the US will need to extend the current run of home domination. There has not been an away win for either team in 13 years and only two this century - both by Europe. Throughout the qualifying process Bradley insisted no one outside the top six spots is guaranteed a pick. \"There are probably going to be a few guys that think they are going to be on the team that aren't going to be,\" Bradley teased. Mood music swinging towards Bradley Justin Thomas, winner of two majors, seems certain of selection after finishing seventh on the table. Everyone else is open to debate. Collin Morikawa, also a two-time major champion and former world number two, finished eighth in qualifying. But the 28-year old-Californian has been patchy at best ever since he blew the chance to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March. He has posted only two top-10s in that period and despite being ranked eighth in the world, has failed to contend ever since that crushing Bay Hill disappointment. There is a better case for the in form Cameron Young (14th in qualifying). A potential rookie, he is a big hitting New Yorker who set the Bethpage course record in a state championship. Patrick Cantlay's feisty Ryder Cup reputation should secure him a third successive appearance despite finishing only 15th in qualifying. His runner-up finish to Fleetwood last week in Atlanta shows he has current form as well. Also hard to ignore is Sam Burns, who nearly won the US Open in June. The 29-year-old from Louisiana is a renowned putter and good friends with world number one Scottie Scheffler. Burns was only 16th in qualifying so higher ranked players would have to be disappointed to accommodate him retaining his place in the US side. Ben Griffin, ninth on the table, has done plenty to justify selection. He has been top-12 in his past four tournaments, has two major top-10s and one of his two wins this year came in the Zurich Classic, a pairs event using the same foursomes and fourball formats of the Ryder Cup. His partner for that success, Andrew Novak, is unlikely to have done enough to warrant selection though and Griffin's relative inexperience at this level may count against him. Maverick McNealy was 10th on the qualifying list and came third at the BMW Championship earlier this month to reinforce his case for a pick. Former Open champion Brian Harman, 12th, is considered too short a hitter for the mighty Bethpage Black course. And where does Bradley fit in? Last week's share of seventh at the Tour Championship, which included middle rounds of 64 and 63 may have convinced him to play. The mood music has swung in that direction and especially if he sees himself as a fourball player. We now know the morning sessions will be alternate shot foursomes and Bradley could sit out those sessions to concentrate on captaincy. But he will have to rely heavily on vice-captains Jim Furyk (the losing skipper in Paris in 2018), Webb Simpson and Brandt Snedeker. The other two assistants Kevin Kisner and Gary Woodland have no Ryder Cup experience. And only Bradley can make the phone calls that will delight and dismay those who are selected or left out. The skipper knows how hard it is to be on the receiving end of bad news and ordinarily would be desperate to play. \"Really awful. Really, really truly awful,\" is how he views the prospect of delivering bad news. Such is his quandary he knows whatever he and his vice-captains decide will be debated ferociously until the match itself delivers its verdict. If, as expected, he gives himself the nod, Bradley knows he will return as a Ryder Cup player 11 years after his last appearance, facing unique challenges and unprecedented scrutiny. Qualifiers: Scottie Scheffler, JJ Spaun (rookie), Xander Schauffele, Russell Henley (rookie), Harris English and Bryson DeChambeau. Wildcards from: Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Ben Griffin (rookie), Maverick McNealy (rookie), Keegan Bradley, Brian Harman, Andrew Novak (rookie), Cameron Young (rookie) Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns.

    "essence": "Princess Diana 90s time capsule contains Kylie CD and pocket TV 7 hours ago Share Save James Chater BBC News Share Save Getty Images Princess Diana visited Great Ormond Street Hospital in March 1991 A time capsule buried by Diana, Princess of Wales at Great Ormond Street Hospital (Gosh) in 1991 has been opened, revealing a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator and a passport. The lead-encased wooden box was sealed to mark the laying of the foundation stone of the hospital's Variety Club Building, which opened in 1994. The items in the capsule were selected by two children who won a Blue Peter competition and were intended to represent life in the 1990s. Other objects included a pocket TV, a snowflake hologram and a photo of Princess Diana. The time capsule was meant to be unearthed in \"hundreds of years\" but was dug up to make way for the construction of a children's cancer centre. Princess Diana became president of Gosh in 1989 and visited the children's hospital several times before her death in 1997. She helped the two children select the items to be placed in the time capsule. The CD of Kylie Minogue's Rhythm of Love album, which was released in 1990 and features the songs 'Better the Devil You Know', 'What Do I Have to Do', and 'Shocked' was one of the 10 items included. The CD was chosen by David Watson, then aged 11, from Paignton, Devon. He also selected a sheet of recycled paper and a passport. Sylvia Foulkes, then aged 9, from Norwich, chose a collection of British coins, a container with five tree seeds, and the snowflake hologram. Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children Kylie Minogue's third studio album Rhythm of Love was in the time capsule The box also included a copy of the Times newspaper from the date of the capsule's burial. Headlines on its front page include: \"Cooked meats bring out Soviet voters in droves\" - alongside a photo of former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev - and \"US rejects Iraqi warplanes plea as rebels close in\". Images released by archivists show some damage to the objects, but they are largely intact. Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children A Casio pocket TV was also included in the time capsule Staff who were either born in 1991 or were already working at the hospital in 1991 helped to remove it. The burial of the time capsule was similar to a ceremony in 1872 during which the then Princess of Wales, Alexandra, laid a foundation stone at the hospital, also sealing a time capsule. That time capsule, which contained a photo of Queen Victoria, has not been found. The new children's cancer centre at Gosh will be a \"national resource of the treatment of childhood cancers\", according to a statement. Its design will help clinical teams develop \"kinder, more effective treatments\" for children staying at the hospital.

    "essence": "Trump's 50% tariff on India kicks in as Modi urges self-reliance 7 hours ago Share Save Nikhil Inamdar BBC News, Mumbai • @Nik_inamdar Share Save Bloomberg via Getty Images Modi has urged small shop owners and businesses to put up \"Made in India\" boards outside their stores Donald Trump's steep 50% tariffs on India have kicked in, weeks after the US president issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% penalty on India over its purchases of Russian oil and weapons. This makes India - one of the US's strongest partners in the Indo-Pacific - among the countries hit with the highest tariffs in the world. This could deal a blow to exports and growth in the world's fifth largest economy, given that the US was, until recently, India's largest trading partner. The tariff setback has sent the Indian government into firefighting mode. Earlier this month, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a promise to cut taxes to mitigate their economic impact. He has also urged domestic self-reliance. He said that a Diwali gift in the form of a \"massive tax bonanza\" was on its way for the common man and the millions of small businesses that power Asia's third largest economy. Wearing a bright saffron turban and addressing crowds of spectators from the ramparts of Delhi's Red Fort during Independence Day celebrations, Modi also urged small shop owners and businesses to put up boards of \"Swadeshi\" or \"Made in India\" outside their stores. \"We should become self-reliant - not out of desperation, but out of pride,\" he said. \"Economic selfishness is on the rise globally and we mustn't sit and cry about our difficulties, we must rise above and not allow others to hold us in their clutches.\" He has since repeated these comments in at least two other public addresses this week. For many watching, this is clearly aimed at countering Donald Trump's brutal 50% tariff rate on India which will disrupt millions of livelihoods across the country's export-driven industries that supply everything from clothes to diamonds and shrimp to American consumers. Amid the blow, Modi's message to his countrymen has been loud and clear - both make in India and spend in India. The former has proved increasingly difficult, with the share of manufacturing as part of India's gross domestic product (GDP) stagnating at 15% levels, despite his government rolling out subsidies and production incentives over the years. But spurring long-pending tax reforms that immediately put more money into the hands of people could help the government soften some of the blow, experts say. And so, after a $12bn income tax giveaway announced in the budget earlier this year, Modi is now aiming for an overhaul of India's indirect tax architecture – a reduction and simplification of the goods & service tax (GST). What tariffs has Trump announced and why? AFP via Getty Images Donald Trump's 50% tariff rate on India comes into effect on 27 August GST, which was introduced eight years ago, replaced a maze of indirect taxes to reduce compliance and the cost of doing business. But experts say it has too many thresholds and exemptions, making the system extremely complicated. They've repeatedly called for it to be revamped. Now, Modi has promised precisely that, with India's finance ministry putting out a proposal for a simplified two-tier GST system. \"Combined with the income tax cut in place from April 2025... the GST rate reforms [likely worth US$20bn; £14.7bn] should together provide a meaningful push to consumption,\" analysts from Jeffries, a US brokerage house, said after the announcement. Private consumption is a mainstay of India's economy, contributing to nearly 60% of the country's GDP. While rural spending – supported by a bumper harvest – has remained strong, demand for goods and services in cities has continued to slow down due to lower wages and job cuts in major sectors like IT, post the pandemic. Modi's \"fiscal stimulus\" or tax cuts should help ensure a consumption recovery, according to investment banking firm Morgan Stanley. It will push GDP up and drag inflation down. \"This is particularly crucial amid headwinds from ongoing global geopolitical tensions and adverse global tariff-related developments that might impair external demand,\" Morgan Stanley said. Among the sectors most likely to benefit from the tax breaks are consumer-facing ones such as, scooters, small cars, garments and even things like cement that goes into making homes, where demand typically picks up pace around Diwali. While the specifics are unknown, most analysts estimate that the revenue loss on account of a lower GST would be offset by surplus collections of some taxes and higher than budgeted dividends from India's central bank. According to Swiss investment bank UBS, the GST cuts will also have a larger \"multiplier effect\" than the previous corporate and income tax cuts undertaken by Modi, as they \"directly affect consumption at the point of purchase, potentially leading to higher consumer spending\". AFP via Getty Images Tariffs disrupt millions of livelihoods across the country's export-driven industries such as textiles Modi's tax handouts could also increase the probability of a further interest rate reduction by India's central bank, which has already slashed rates by 1% in the past few months - something that is likely to spur more lending, according to analysts. This, along with a boost in the salaries of nearly five million government employees and 6.8 million pensioners that kicks in early next year, will help India's economy retain its growth momentum, they say. India's stock markets have cheered these announcements. And despite the panic caused by trade uncertainties, earlier this month, India also got a rare sovereign rating upgrade from S&P Global, after a gap of 18 years. A sovereign rating measures how risky it is to lend to a government or invest in a country. This is significant because it could lower the government's borrowing costs and improve foreign investment flows into the country. But even as Modi rushes through with long-delayed reforms, India's growth prospects have slowed significantly from the 8% levels seen a few years ago, and its external crisis shows no sign of ebbing. The war of words between Delhi and Washington, especially over the former's energy purchases from Russia, have only intensified and trade negotiations which were set to begin earlier this week, have been called off. Meanwhile, at 50%, the tariffs on India are akin to a sanction on trade between the world's biggest and fastest growing economies, say experts - a scenario that would have been unthinkable even just a few months ago.

Police have confirmed that they are searching for Dezi Bird Freeman, a conspiracy theorist and self-described \"sovereign citizen\" who rejects government and law. Freeman, 56, has a long history with the police, and his hatred of authority has been well documented in online posts, videos and court documents. He has called police \"terrorist thugs\", compared them to Nazis and tried to arrest a magistrate during court proceedings. Manhunt under way after two police shot dead in rural Australian town Officers killed in shooting named by police, as manhunt continues Covid and conspiracies Less than a week before the shooting of two police in Porepunkah, his wife, Mali, had told a neighbour that she was concerned about his behaviour, The Age reports. Locals in the town have told journalists that the father of two was kind and polite, but then, during the Covid pandemic, his behaviour became erratic and his views more extreme. Freeman - born Desmond Christopher Filby - developed a public profile for his views on the health crisis. He refused to wear face masks in shops, rejected vaccinations and became increasingly outspoken about his distrust of the government restrictions and lockdowns - of which Victoria had particularly long and strict ones. \"He was anti everything to do with it,\" one local told the Sydney Morning Herald. \"He went from being just a pretty ordinary country bloke… a normal dude you'd see at the local footy club all the time to quite a strange bloke. He fell down a bit of a rabbit hole and sort of disappeared and went off the radar.\" A 'sovereign citizen' Australian media reports that Freeman describes himself as a \"sovereign citizen\", who typically believe they are immune from government rules. In Australia, the movement saw a particular boom during the Covid lockdowns of 2020. Victoria's then-Chief Police Commissioner Shane Patton said at the time that officers were forced \"to smash the windows of cars and pull people out to provide details\" after they refused to answer questions or show documents. An Australian Federal Police briefing note from 2023 said the movement had \"an underlying capacity to inspire violence\". What is the 'sovereign citizen' movement? In 2021, Freeman was involved in an attempt to have then-state Premier Daniel Andrews tried for treason. Freeman was arrested outside a court in Victoria, where around 250 anti-government protesters had assembled. In a video of his arrest, he can be heard telling the crowd: \"They're gonna make some [expletive] up about me mate, because I stood up to them.\" The treason case was thrown out. EPA/Shutterstock Police officers conducted searches in Porepunkah following Tuesday's incident 'You are now in my custody' Freeman has been in and out of court for years, mainly on driving charges, some of which were dropped. His conduct in court showed his contempt for authority. \"Shame on you!\" he shouted at a judge last year, who refused to drop his driving charges. Freeman claimed that he was under duress when the police pulled him over, and acting in self-defence by filming them with his phone as he drove off. He argued that he was worried they might try to arrest him, which would be \"an assault and abduction\". \"I felt threatened and preyed upon.... even the sight of a cop or a cop car... it's like an Auschwitz survivor seeing a Nazi soldier,\" Freeman said, court documents show . The same file shows him referring to police as \"frigging Nazis\", \"Gestapo\" and \"terrorist thugs\". In one of his more sensational court appearances, he tried to arrest a magistrate and police officer during a dispute over public access to a national park. \"You're acting oppressively,\" he told the judge. \"You must stand down, and are now in my custody and under arrest. You are not free to leave.\" He then ordered a police officer to arrest the magistrate, and when the officer refused, Freeman said he was under arrest too. They ignored him. Experienced bushman Watch: Australia police shooting suspect is still at large and \"heavily armed\" Neighbours say that Freeman and his family live on a bus on a 20-hectare plot on the outskirts of Porepunkah. Locals told journalists that they thought he lived with several people on the property, in a kind of compound, secured by a big gate with security cameras. Australian media say the police officers were entering the bus to search it when they were shot at. Freeman was last seen running into dense bushland nearby. Police say they understand he is an experienced bushman - or a person familiar with the wilderness - which presents a challenge for the search party hunting for him. \"He's well-versed in the bush and there's caves up there, so it'll be a while before they find him, I think,\" a neighbour told the ABC. Police have warned that Freeman is \"heavily armed\", and the Sydney Morning Herald reports that he is believed to have stolen the guns of the police officers that he allegedly shot. 'Pillar of Porepunkah' The Freemans - Dezi, Mali and their children - have lived in the Porepunkah area for many years and were known around the small community. Mali teaches music to children and works at a supermarket. In 2018, the family featured on Channel Nine's A Current Affair programme, where they lamented about their \"neighbours from hell\" at a previous property, who were intimidating and disruptive. \"Mali and her family are all very kind, very beautiful people,\" a neighbour, whose grandchildren took music lessons with Mali, told the programme.
