Arwa Mahdawi The California governor is one of the few Democrats who seems ready to play the president at his own game. But he also has to show voters that he has empathy and a vision for their future Tue 26 Aug 2025 15.22 CEST Last modified on Tue 26 Aug 2025 15.24 CEST Share E very time you think US politics could not possibly get any stupider, it does. Today’s instalment of “we live in hell, where politicians are passing around the last remaining brain cell” comes via New York and the latest shenanigans of the city’s mayor, Eric Adams. Desperate to distract voters from a steady stream of scandals, the latest of which involves a former aide giving a reporter a crisp packet filled with cash after an Adams mayoral campaign event, he is trying hard to flex his social media muscles. This weekend, Adams joined Andrew Cuomo, the former governor who is running as an independent in November’s election, and others in mocking Zohran Mamdani , the charismatic Democratic candidate and frontrunner, for his weightlifting efforts at a community event. Adams posted a side-by-side video on X of himself and Mamdani bench-pressing with the caption: “67 vs. 33 … The weight of the job is too heavy for ‘Mamscrawny.’ The only thing he can lift is your taxes.” This post was quickly deleted and replaced with one that got Adams’s age right: he is 64. Inventing childish nicknames for your rivals? Classic Donald Trump. Getting basic facts embarrassingly wrong? Super Trumpy. Obsessing over your manliness, rather than focusing on issues voters care about? Trumpy to the max. ‘No-holds-barred fight’: California’s governor takes off his gloves to punch back at Trump Read more Adams isn’t the only politician emulating the president’s idiosyncratic communication style. Across the globe, we are witnessing the seemingly unstoppable rise of the trollitician . From the Australian senator Ralph Babet tweeting tirades about “ woke ass clowns ” to the US vice-president, JD Vance, insulting the IQs of his detractors , an increasing number of politicos seem to be operating like attention-seeking edgelords rather than dignified statespeople. If it worked for Trump, their reasoning seems to go, they too may have a shot at shitposting their way to the top. Playing Trump’s social media game rather better than anyone else at the moment is Gavin Newsom. In recent weeks, the governor of California, clearly readying himself for a 2028 presidential run, has been giving his caps lock key quite the pounding to troll Trump by adopting his social media vernacular. “TRUMP JUST FLED THE PODIUM WITH PUTIN … THE MAN LOOKED LIKE HE’D JUST EATEN 3 BUCKETS OF KFC WITH VLAD,” reads one mocking tweet from the governor’s press office this month. Newsom has also opened an online “Patriot shop”, poking fun at Trump’s tasteless merchandise. There are red-and-white baseball caps emblazoned with “NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!” and tank tops proclaiming “Trump is not hot”. There is also a Bible priced at $100 (£74). It’s sold out, but if God is good, and supply chains oblige, it will be back in stock soon. Some of Newsom’s posts have been very amusing; they have certainly generated a lot of publicity for him and delighted many liberals. I am no Newsom fan – he has flip-flopped opportunistically on transgender issues and taken a questionable stand on pro-Palestine campus protests – but it’s refreshing to see energy from the opposition. The Democrats are losing voters at a staggering rate and the party’s out-of-touch leaders can’t seem to pull themselves together to challenge Trump effectively. By contrast, Newsom seems ready for a fight. 2:10 'They fired the first shot': Newsom signs bill to put redistricting to California's voters – video This isn’t to suggest that snarky tweets are the way to defeat Maga. Newsom has said his bombastic posts are meant to shine a light on Trump’s unpresidential behaviour: “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president.” But it doesn’t matter if you shine a stadium’s worth of floodlights on a problem if people wilfully avoid looking. You can’t shame many of Trump’s supporters because they have no shame; you can’t use logic with people in a personality cult. Crucially, however, Newsom isn’t stopping at mean tweets. He has shown that he will not just sit down and whine as the Republicans use dirty tricks such as redrawing the voting map in Texas; he will try to use the same redistricting tactics in California . Newsom has grasped what so many other Democrats are loth to admit: you can’t keep playing by the same old rules when the other side has ripped up the rulebook. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To win, Democrats need to show normal people that they will fight for them. People don’t want silly tweets and underhand tactics; they want politicians who will lower the cost of living and direct taxes towards healthcare and infrastructure rather than bombing starving children in Gaza. Running on popular policies and seemingly authentic empathy is what has made Mamdani – who is still being shunned by Democratic leadership – such an effective candidate.

    "essence": "Video platform Kick investigated over streamer's death 12 minutes ago Share Save Graham Fraser Technology Reporter Share Save @jeanpormanove French prosecutors have opened an investigation into the Australian video platform Kick over the death of a content creator during a livestream. Raphaël Graven - also known as Jean Pormanove - was found dead in a residence near the city of Nice last week. He was known for videos in which he endured apparent violence and humiliation. The Paris prosecutor said the investigation would look into whether Kick knowingly broadcast \"videos of deliberate attacks on personal integrity\". The BBC has approached Kick for comment. A spokesperson for the platform previously said the company was \"urgently reviewing\" the circumstances around Mr Graven's death. The prosecutor's investigation will also seek to determine whether Kick complied with the European Union's Digital Services Act, and the obligation on platforms to notify the authorities if the life or safety of individuals is in question. In a separate announcement, France's minister for digital affairs, Clara Chappaz, said the government would sue the platform for \"negligence\" over its failure to block \"dangerous content\", according to the AFP news agency. 'Absolute horror' Mr Graven was found dead on 18 August. Local media reported the 46-year-old had been subject to bouts of violence and sleep deprivation during streams, and died in his sleep during a live broadcast. In a post on X the next day Chappaz, described his death as an \"absolute horror\", and said he had been humiliated and mistreated on the platform for months. A postmortem carried out later that week revealed Mr Graven's death was not the result of trauma or the actions of a third party. Local police have seized videos and interviewed a number of people they say were present when he died. They also disclosed Mr Graven had previously been spoken to by detectives and had \"firmly denied\" being a victim of violence, saying the acts he was involved in were staged to \"create a buzz\" and make money. Kick is a platform similar to Twitch on which users can broadcast content and interact with other users in real time. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of Jean Pormanove and extend our condolences to his family, friends and community,\" said Kick in its previous statement. The platform's community guidelines were \"designed to protect creators\" and Kick was \"committed to upholding these standards across our platform\", its spokesperson added.

Unveiling Reform UK’s “Operation Restoring Justice” at a combative Oxford press conference, Farage claimed his party would detain and deport “absolutely anyone” arriving by small boat and ensure they are “never, ever allowed to stay”, insisting this would stop crossings “within days” and “save tens and possibly hundreds of billions of pounds”. Pressed by reporters, Farage confirmed that women and children would also be detained under the plans, conceding that “how we deal with children is a more complicated and difficult issue” but insisting all arrivals would be subject to removal. Reform councillor works on asylum claims for Home Office, investigation reveals Read more But Farage repeatedly dodged questions about how the scheme would work in practice. He was unable to name a single RAF base to be converted into secure detention facilities, despite insisting they would be central to his plans. He offered no detail on how Reform would secure deportation agreements with countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Sudan, many of which have no return treaties with the UK and are considered unsafe by British courts. Farage could not explain how Reform’s scheme would be funded, beyond claiming costs would be a fraction of independent estimates. Reform’s leadership said it would repeal the Human Rights Act, leave the European Convention on Human Rights, and disapply the 1951 refugee convention and UN convention against torture, with senior figure Zia Yusuf declaring that “no lawyer and no judge” would be able to prevent deportation flights from leaving. Kolbassia Haoussou, director of survivor leadership at Freedom from Torture, called the plans “a gift to repressive regimes” and said Britain would be abandoning one of humanity’s “clearest moral lines”. He said: “This is not who we are as a country. “Men, women and children are coming to the UK looking for safety. They are fleeing the unimaginable horrors of torture in places like Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran. These laws were created in the aftermath of the second world war to protect us all. If Britain were to abandon",

Justyna Czoska, 52, a horse riding instructor, and her partner, Wojtek Kowalkowski, 49, from Bloxham, Oxfordshire, died after the aircraft crash-landed at about 9.24am on Monday between Shanklin and Whiteley Bank. The helicopter had taken off from Sandown airport 20 minutes earlier. Another person was also killed, while a fourth was taken to hospital and is said to be in a serious condition.

This sudden and devastating event has left all us heartbroken and struggling to cope with the loss. “We are now trying to bring them both back to Poland so they can be laid to rest with their families, in the place they called home. The cost of repatriation, funeral arrangements and travel is more than we can manage alone, and we are asking for support during this incredibly difficult time. “Any donation, no matter how small, will help us give them the farewell they deserve. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your kindness, support, and for keeping our family in your thoughts. With love, Jacob and Julia.” Posting on Facebook, Buzar said: “I have no words, the world took my mum too soon, she was the best mum you could ask for, loved by everyone. “I never thought I’d be writing something like this. Please, if anyone could help bring them back to Poland so they can be with their families it would mean the world to me … Rest in peace mum and Wojtek.” The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has launched a formal inquiry into the crash.

If the EU will not act collectively, member states must take steps individually or in smaller groups to support human rights and uphold international law, the letter says, laying out nine possible approaches. They include suspending arms export licenses, barring trade in goods and services with illegal settlements and barring European datacentres from receiving, storing or processing data from Israeli government or commercial sources if it relates to Israel’s “presence and activities in Gaza and elsewhere in the occupied territories”. Signatories include 110 former ambassadors, 25 former director general and two of the most senior diplomats in the EU – Alain Le Roy , former secretary general of the European External Affairs service and Carlo Trojan, former secretary general of the European Commission. “This struck a chord,” said Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff , former EU representative to the Palestinian territory and part of a steering group of 6 former diplomats coordinating the initiative which began in mid-July. This letter was the third public call for action, and the first calling for nations to act individually if the EU does not take collective action. A proposal to partly suspend Israel from the Horizon research fund over Gaza failed in late July. “There is such dismay now within the institutions, people are saying enough is enough,” Kühn von Burgsdorff said. “We can’t stay paralysed if the 27 (member states) can’t take action, that betrays our values.

Party leader Nigel Farage set out a five-year plan to detain and deport all migrants who arrive in the UK without permission and suggested 600,000 people could be sent back over five years. Under the plan, named Operation Restoring Justice, Reform UK would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, and strike deals with countries to return those people. Reform UK says it would make £2bn available for returns deals, with aid offered as an incentive and sanctions potentially imposed on uncooperative countries. Farage vows mass deportations to tackle small boats Difficult decisions lie ahead after asylum seeker hotel ruling &#x27;People are angry&#x27;: Behind the wave of asylum hotel protests How many people cross the Channel in small boats? Launching his plan, Farage described illegal migration as a \"scourge\" on the UK. \"The only way we&#x27;ll stop the boats is by detaining and deporting absolutely anyone who comes via that route,\" Farage said. \"And if we do that, the boats will stop coming in days because there will be no incentive,\" he added. Farage, who had previously said mass deportations were a \"political impossibility\", said his party had now come up with \"a credible plan, so that we can deport hundreds of thousands of people over the five years of a Reform government\". During the news conference, Farage asked senior Reform UK figure Zia Yusuf whether it was realistic to deport 600,000 people within five years, and in reply he said \"totally, yeah\". Reform UK&#x27;s policy would amount to a huge increase in the number of deportations and goes further than any previous plans outlined by other political parties.

The party’s deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: (Nigel) Farage’s plan crumbles under the most basic scrutiny. The idea that Reform UK is going to magic up some new places to detain people and deport them to, but don’t have a clue where those places would be, is taking the public for fools. Of course Nigel Farage wants to follow his idol Vladimir Putin in ripping up the human rights convention. Winston Churchill would be turning in his grave. Doing so would only make it harder for each of us as individuals to hold the government to account and stop it trampling on our freedoms. On potential payments to the Taliban to take back Afghan migrants, Cooper added: Reform’s Taliban tribute plan would send British taxpayers’ cash to fund their oppressive regime, fuelling the persecution of Afghan women and children and betraying our brave armed forces who sacrificed so much fighting the Taliban. Clearly British values mean nothing to Farage and his band of plastic patriots. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said Reform’s plans don’t stand up to scrutiny.

The winners of Wednesday’s semi-finals will progress to Saturday’s finals and play for a place in mid-September’s final round of qualifying. Here are eight players to keep an eye on this week. Julia Zigiotti (Manchester United): With Fridolina Rolfö continuing to recover from the injury that hampered her at Euro 2025, plenty of eyes will be on her compatriot and now club-mate Zigiotti. The Swede was United’s other marquee signing this summer and brings a wealth of experience. The tenacious defensive midfielder arrived after a double-winning season with Bayern Munich and was at the heart of her country’s run to the quarter-finals in Switzerland. Zigiotti will be familiar to Women’s Super League fans from her two-year spell at Brighton. Her key qualities lie in her ability to link the transition from defence to attack as well as her quality in the press and work ethic. Her introduction will perhaps allow Dominique Janssen to return to her more natural defensive position. Riola Xhemaili (PSV): The midfielder wrote her name into the Swiss football history books this summer with a 92nd-minute equaliser against Finla",

The winger continued to show why he is one of the top-rated young players in the country when he made his Premier League debut at 15 years and 234 days on Saturday against Leeds United. The appearance made him the second-youngest player to represent the club and the second-youngest to play in the Premier League - with team-mate Ethan Nwaneri holding both records. His talent and his rise are no shock to anyone who has been around Arsenal for the past couple of years. He has been training with the first-team squad since he was 14. Having a player with so much promise competing in senior football means Arsenal have put measures in place both for his career progression and his safeguarding. These include where he gets changed, a strong focus on his education and also making sure that a boy in an adult team environment is well supported by his team-mates. Manager Mikel Arteta and the club have been cautious about how they manage Dowman&#x27;s progress. Arteta said after his debut against Leeds that they have been gathering information about how he reacts to certain situations, whether that is being on the bench, training with the first team or not being named in the squad at all.

As a consequence of their 15th-placed Premier League finish and Europa League final defeat by Tottenham, United are missing out on Europe for only the second time since English clubs returned to Uefa competition after a five-year ban in 1990. It means they must start their Carabao Cup campaign a round earlier than usual, with Wednesday&#x27;s tie at League Two Grimsby their first meeting since 1948. However, Amorim feels this is a minor issue compared to the free midweeks he will get to work with his players as the season progresses. \"We were not prepared to play in Europe and the Premier League,\" he said. \"We need time to develop as a team.\" United&#x27;s previous entry into round two of the competition was in 2014 and ended in embarrassing fashion with a 4-0 defeat at then League One MK Dons, who had an 18-year-old Dele Alli in their side. Now, as then, the intention is to make changes to the team that started Saturday&#x27;s 1-1 draw at Fulham. \"We have three games this week and we have quality players, so we need rotation to try to win every game,\" said Amorim. England duo Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire, plus midfielder Manuel Ugarte and striker Joshua Zirkzee are among the senior players who have been among the substitutes but had limited – or none in the case of Mainoo and Zirkzee – playing time so far this season. Goalkeeper Andre Onana is also likely to come into contention, along with youngsters Ayden Heaven and Tyler Fredricson.

Hadush Kebatu, from Ethiopia, is accused of making \"inappropriate comments\" after the children thought he looked hungry and offered him food in Epping, Essex, on 7 July. He then returned the following day and asked one of the girls to kiss her friend, Chelmsford Magistrates&#x27; Court was told. Mr Kebatu, an asylum seeker who was living at The Bell Hotel in High Road, Epping, is on trial having denied two sexual offences. He has also denied charges of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity, attempted sexual assault and harassment without violence. Mr Kebatu gave his date of birth as in December 1986, making him 38, but court records have suggested he is 41. PA Media Protests took place outside The Bell Hotel in Epping after the allegations against Hadush Kebatu - who was lodging there - emerged Opening the trial, prosecutor Stuart Cowen said the defendant approached the girls, who were sitting on a bench eating pizza, and made \"inappropriate comments\". \"It is the Crown&#x27;s case he said he wanted to have a baby with each of them and attempted to kiss them,\" Mr Cowen said. \"He invited them back to The Bell Hotel where he was a resident, having recently arrived in the UK.\" Having been rejected and told the girls were 14, Mr Kebatu responded \"age did not matter\", Mr Cowen alleged. He said the girls left the area but were approached by the asylum seeker the following day. On this occasion, it was alleged one of the teenagers was wearing her school uniform.

How punks inspired by Thatcher built a Hull housing cooperative Set up in the 1980s, Giroscope has morphed into a social agency running neighbourhood services and creating jobs Peter Hetherington Tue 26 Aug 2025 14.00 CEST Last modified on Tue 26 Aug 2025 15.00 CEST Share F orty years ago, a small group of students and university dropouts living rough had a novel idea. What if they pooled meagre savings and jobless benefits for a modest terrace house, rather than rent a run-down flat? They raised a deposit for a £3,200 mortgage on a neglected two-bedroom property in the Victorian terraces of west Hull , running down to the quayside of a once-thriving fishing port, from where boats used to trawl the north Atlantic. Their enthusiasm for punk bands – the Clash, the Specials and New Model Army – belied a determination to work the system rather than fight the class war in a city evoked by the late poet Philip Larkin, former University of Hull librarian: “Spires and cranes … ships up streets.” So began the ultimate counter-revolution for a group, driven by what Martin Newman, a founder, called “green, practical anarchism”. After largely teaching themselves bricklaying, joinery and plumbing, they asked a simple question: in solving their own accommodation crisis, why not help others sleeping rough? A workers’ cooperative was thus born as Giroscope – fittingly named after the ubiquitous giro benefit cheques of the high unemployment 1980s. Pooling these partly funded their first acquisition and laid the foundations for what is now a multimillion-pound charitable social enterprise, headed by the tireless Newman. Their tentative steps into property development soon became a campaign for more housing renewal in a long-neglected inner-city area in a country with some of the oldest housing stock in Europe: more than a third of English homes, for instance, are well over 80 years old. View image in fullscreen Martin Newman in St Matthew’s church. Giroscope is due to open the Grade 2-listed building as a workspace and social centre for the community. Photograph: Gary Calton/The Guardian But the group’s inspiration emerged from the unlikeliest ideology: Thatcherism. Deregulation of the mortgage market early in the late PM’s premiership led to looser borrowing, with banks giving loans alongside building societies. “She was encouraging people to make money, so we hatched this plan to organise and achieve rather than bring down capitalism first,” says Newman, pragmatic punk turned social property developer. “Credit became easy.

Meanwhile, two very different brothers navigate reconnection after one is released from prison: Matt (Michael Coombes), the younger brother, is a shy, soft kind of guy, while ex-con Ewan (Pete Bird) is confident and cocky and seemingly determined to head straight back down the kind of path that led to him getting banged up in the first place. Only this time, perhaps he’ll drag his little brother along for the ride. Derelict is self-evidently a low-budget affair – it reportedly took as little as £35k to film on location in Herefordshire, and that lack of resource can’t always be concealed. There are also a fair few instances of sequences that presumably felt realistic on the page but strike a false note on the screen: for example, it will never be convincing to have one actor stand still while yelling “come back!” as another actor walks away from them. It might sound pedantic but it’s the kind of thing that gives a telenovela feel to a film aiming for gritty realism. Some of the acting is likewise variable in its plausibility. But two players in particular stand out. As Abigail, Fulton paints a portrait of a woman who has shut down almost completely, while still giving us enough to go on that we stay with the character’s pain. And Coombes, as younger brother Matt, brings a soulful authenticity to a layered and original role. This is a film that you will need to make some allowances for – it’s clearly a labour of love and in dire need of a tighter edit – but there’s talent here: call it a diamond in the rough.

But I often struggle to finish a jar – any advice on other ways of using it ? Chris, via email “I’m absolutely stunned that Chris has any problem finishing a jar of XO sauce, ” says Fuchsia Dunlop, author of Invitation to a Banquet: The Story of Chinese Food . “You can literally eat the stuff by the spoonful straight from the jar, although that would feel quite extravagant.” This, of course, is because the umami condiment, said to have been invented in Hong Kong’s Spring Moon restaurant at the Peninsula hotel in the mid-1980s, is something of a luxury. As Jenny Lau, author of An A-Z of Chinese Food , explains, XO sauce “must contain three core ingredients: dried shrimp, dried scallop and preserved ham”, which don’t come cheap. “Anything else, though, and it will be an imitation.” The powerhouse sauce, which also features chillies and alliums, is used both in cooking and as a table condiment. “It basically makes anything taste more interesting,” Dunlop says, and Chris is on the right track with what he’s been doing with it. “One of the best ways to appreciate XO sauce is to have it with plain rice; you taste that lovely, chewy texture, the delicious savouriness of the scallops and the kick of chilli heat.” And, because it’s oil-based, XO works brilliantly in fried dishes, too, although that doesn’t include fried rice in Dunlop’s book: “While it is delicious, I feel that’s a bit of a waste,” she says. “I’d rather use dried shrimp in fried rice and keep my XO sauce for having bits in your chopsticks to enjoy.” That might be in stir-fried noodles, say, or spooned into veg: “I once had some amazing stir-fried king oyster mushrooms with XO sauce in Hangzhou,” Dunlop says. But, really, XO sauce will “bring depth to just about anything bland”, Lau says, so be sure to try it with white meat or fish, too. “The Cantonese way of cooking is that we don’t over-season things, so XO adds that special element to simple, home-cooked dishes.” Another case in point is eggs: “It’s fantastic with poached eggs, fried eggs, boiled eggs, well, any kind of eggs, really,” Dunlop says, so that’s something she’ll often have for breakfast. Buttered crumpets are another good vehicle for XO sauce, she adds, because “you’re using it as an accompaniment in the Chinese way, but you can really taste it because it’s on the top”. Otherwise, try it in a sandwich: “It’s common to have mayo mashups, such as with sriracha, so why not add a spoonful of XO sauce instead?” Lau says, or blend the stuff with peanut butter, a little water, some soy sauce and maybe some vinegar: “That’s a really nice dressing for noodles or pasta salad, or even a salad,” says Lau. “Just add a tablespoon much as you would pesto.” And here’s another thing: XO sauce does keep – “as long as everything is below the oil,” Lau notes – so there’s no immediate rush for Chris to finish that jar, anyway. That said, cook some rice, poach some eggs and get a load of crumpets in, and it won’t be hanging around all that much longer. Got a culinary dilemma?

Ábrego, a Maryland resident who had never been charged with any crime either in the US or in his native El Salvador, became a symbol of the Trump administration’s ambitiously sadistic anti-immigration efforts when he was kidnapped by I agents in March and sent without due process to Cecot, a massive prison in El Salvador from which few detainees are ever released, as a result of what representatives for the Trump immigration authorities called an administrative error. Ábrego became a symbol for the several hundred men who had been deprived of their liberty and deported to the distant foreign prison without due process and in defiance of both American and international law. It was only after extensive public pressure on the issue – including visits to Cecot and demands to see Ábrego from prominent Democratic politicians, including Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland senator – that Ábrego was returned to the US. The Trump administration ginned up a fake, face-saving excuse for his return, claiming Ábrego needed to be tried for alleged crimes in the US. But that was never anything but a cover, a lie to avoid admitting that they were bringing him back under political pressure and that such pressure could make them cave again. Still, Maga does not forgive Ábrego for his innocence; its adherents decided to make an example of him. Now, released from jail on those trumped-up and unproven allegations, Ábrego has been arrested again by Ice. This time, the Trump administration says it plans to deport him to Uganda – a country he has never been to – as part of a new third-country deportation scheme recently blessed by the supreme court. Why Trump built a staff of incompetent sycophants | Robert Reich Read more The Trump administration has continued to pursue Ábrego, in spite of his obvious innocence, because they see the outcry over his accidental arrest and deportation as an unacceptably embarrassing stain on their anti-immigrant agenda. His arrest exposed the cruelty, randomness and essential malignant incompetence of Trump’s vast, unaccountable, rec",

Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images Rivers ‘It’s a disaster’: drought measure to suck water from River Wharfe met with anger Campaigners accuse Yorkshire Water of negligence and say plan to top up reservoirs will kill the river’s fish Helena Horton Environment reporter Tue 26 Aug 2025 13.47 CEST Last modified on Tue 26 Aug 2025 14.54 CEST Share W ith its pebble beach and shallow areas for paddling, the River Wharfe at Ilkley has long been a popular swimming location in the pretty Yorkshire town. But plagued by sewage and agricultural runoff, the river has been designated as “poor” quality, and a sign has been put up warning people against bathing in it. And now, the health of the river has been put further at risk with emergency drought plans by Yorkshire Water to suck water from it to top up its reservoirs. A drive by campaigners and wild swimmers led it in 2021 to be the first in the country to get designated bathing status – meaning the government tests it for the harmful E coli and intestinal enterococci bacteria. Yorkshire went into drought in mid-June, with locals banned from using hosepipes from early July. Reservoir levels continue to drop, despite recent rain. They dropped to 62.9% on Monday from 66.1% the previous week, well below the average of 87.8% for August. To top them up, the company has applied for an emergency drought order to extract additional water from the river, and to reduce the amount it releases into the river from Grimwith reservoir. On Friday, this was approved by the Environment Agency (EA). The government quango admitted that “the issuing of this permit will mean a reduced amount of water in the designated bathing water”. Prof Becky Malby, from the Ilkley Clean River Group, said: “The less water in the river, the more that pollution is concentrated from agriculture and from sewage, which means the oxygen levels will be low. When it’s warm and the river is in such low flow, the water heats up. This means that the fish in the river will overheat, suffocate and die. It’s a disaster for the environment.” View image in fullscreen The water quality of the Wharfe at Ilkley has been shown to be poor during recent testing. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images Rivers have been bearing the brunt of this year’s drought, with Southern Water having applied to take enough water from a rare chalk stream to take it below its ecologically safe level. The musician turned water campaigner Feargal Sharkey also raised the alarm after his local river was drastically reduced in volume by the EA. Yorkshire Water has been criticised for a slow response to plummeting reservoir levels and failing to build enough of them; there has been no major reservoir built in England in more than 30 years. The company has also been widely criticised for allowing sewage to spill into nearby rivers, including the Wharfe. Despite these failings, the chief executive of the company has managed to retain a high income. The Guardian recently revealed the boss of Yorkshire Water, Nicola Shaw, has received £1.3m in previously undisclosed extra pay since 2023 through an offshore parent company, on top of her large salary and bonuses. Though nearby fish farms, campsites and private septic tanks cause some pollution into the Wharfe, the two main causes are sewage pollution and agricultural runoff. Recent sampling by the EA found nitrates and phosphates from farming in the river, and also found that after heavy rain the presence of harmful bacteria from animal faeces increases, which means runoff from farms is having an impact as well as the sewage outflows in the area. After public pressure, Yorkshire Water is building new sewers around the river to clean it up. The draining of the river will have dire consequences for it, says the ecologist Prof Rick Battarbee. “It’s a serious issue,” he said, “especially for fish potentially trapped in pockets of poor quality water. The river will also have reduced capacity to dilute treated effluent that is continually discharged into the river from sewage treatment works downstream, which means that nutrient pollution becomes more severe and faecal bacteria concentrations will be higher.” He pointed out the bathing site is “ironically situated just 4km or so downstream of the Lobwood abstraction point. The site has failed to achieve safe bathing status each of the four years since designation – taking more water out of the river will not help this year’s compliance statistics.” Campaigners have said that the company, and the government, should have been much faster to encourage the public to conserve water at the first signs of drought, and to ensure pipes were properly maintained so they did not leak water. Drought bringing autumn harvest two weeks early, Waitrose says Read more Malby said: “It is shocking that Yorkshire Water can be allowed to leak 260m litres a day but has been granted a permit to extract 120m litres a day from our river which is already so low is it endangering our wildlife. There has been no national campaign to reduce water usage, no plan to conserve and protect water when Yorkshire Water and the regulators have seen this coming for years. Water extraction would not be needed if we had effective plans to store and manage water, and our water pipes were properly maintained. We see no plans from government, water companies and regulators to address this shocking negligence.” The chief executive of River Action, James Wallace, added: “Allowing such a nationally significant stretch of river to bear the cost of poor long-term planning sets a worrying precedent. Water companies have had decades to prepare for climate change. The science has long warned us of hotter summers, shifting rainfall and severe droughts. Yet not a single new reservoir has been built since privatisation in 1989. Instead, billions have flowed out in dividends, while chief executives pocket vast bonuses.” Claire Barrow, Environment Agency Yorkshire’s drought manager, said: “Despite recent rainfall in Yorkshire, this has not been enough to refill rivers and reservoirs, and water supplies continue to decline. This permit will allow Yorkshire Water’s reservoir stocks to remain for longer, so it protects that level of public supply. We only issue a permit if we are content that there are clear plans in place to mitigate any impact on the environment, along with strong evidence from Yorkshire Water of their ongoing commitment to reduce leaks and improve water efficiency.” Dave Kaye, the director of water at Yorkshire Water, said: “The application and implementation process of the drought permit is tightly regulated, and clear conditions are outlined as to when it’s possible to use the permit. Specialist independent consultants have already assessed the environmental risks of implementing a drought permit. These have been agreed by the Environment Agency as part of this process. Once implemented, we will continue to monitor the permit to ensure any environmental impacts on the downstream ecology are mitigated.” Explore more on these topics Rivers Yorkshire Water Wildlife Conservation Environment Agency features Share Reuse this content",

It is I, Robert Jenrick Marina Hyde When I gaze deep into my own eyes, what do I see? An iron-willed, crime-crushing flag-raiser whose ascent to the Tory leadership is surely inevitable Tue 26 Aug 2025 13.44 CEST Last modified on Tue 26 Aug 2025 15.04 CEST Share I wake up early – earlier than Nigel Farage. Not drinking as much as him helps. But look, no shade. As I keep telling interviewers, I admire Nigel’s longevity . He can keep going for ever, can’t he, aged whatever-he-is and with that lifestyle, which makes his biological age only a couple of months more than Joe Biden’s was last summer. I’m a huge fan. Then it’s a pacy run round the constituency, or one of the nicer bits of London or Herefordshire if I’m at one of my other houses. If I spot a lamp-post that hasn’t been flagged, I make a mental note to go mental at the team. By next week I want to be photographed St Georgeing anything over 10 foot: wind turbines, 5G masts, the giraffes at London zoo. Then we stick it on the socials. Run me up the flagpole and see who salutes me. Breakfast is typically a full English yoghurt and whichever type of coffee doesn’t constitute taking the wrong side in the culture war. I previously took Ozempic but I didn’t inhale. What people see now is the result of me, personally, taking a stand. I had the discipline to control my northern border – my mouth – rather than letting it be a soft touch for marauding doughnuts or foreign pastries who should quite reasonably have sought refuge somewhere safe but weak, like within France or James Cleverly. As I survey myself in the mirror, I’m incredibly proud of the fact that I went so much further than one-in, one-out. Far more crap now leaves my gob than goes into it. That’s down to the same iron will I would bring to the leadership of the Conservative party. Not that there’s a vacancy; Kemi’s doing a great job. Certainly a job. A part-time job, some would say. I’m sure she’s exhausted herself quite enough for one week with her Sunday Times interview . Of course, they asked her about everyone saying I was soon to be leader of the Tory party, and she said: “I think even Rob himself finds it distressing.” Bless her. But what she needs to remember is that I’m much, much stronger than that. Then it’s straight into the Range Rover and off to work, unless I’m doing a video in a tube station. I’m getting incredible feedback for my videos from people who would previously have given me a wedgie. Having said that, last week I saw the most problematic thing I’ve seen on a phone since Richard Desmond showed me his property development idea at a Conservative fundraiser and I personally greenlit it . This time, though, it’s on my phone, and it’s a video posted by Chris Philp where he says he got threatened with a knife at the migrant camp in Calais. I immediately texted Chris: “Who do you think you are – Mr Beast?” Got the cryface emoji back so had to press it. “Seriously mate, who do you think you are???” Reaching the office, I discover another big shipment of flags has arrived from Temu. I ignored last week’s message from the Department for Business that I am personally increasing the trade deficit with China: patriotism is bigger than all that stuff. I may not buy British but I certainly fly British. One of the team has left out a print-out of the recent ConservativeHome popularity ranking , which I topped. That’s a nice touch – if you want to work with me, you need to be committed to the project. I like to joke that it’s the law, and I know because I used to be justice secretary. Well, secretary to the justice secretary, but yeah. Same difference. The morning is spent publicly complaining about things we either didn’t fix or made worse when in office, but I don’t see contradictions. Some might say I was one of the public faces of the campaign to lock people up during the pandemic. But they forget I actually twice freestyled the rules – so what did I really believe? Honestly, I’m embarrassed for people who keep bringing up past versions of Robert Jenrick. It’s like talking about Peter Parker before he was bitten by the radioactive spider, or the Hulk before he gets the gamma dose. Seriously, if Marvel did shadow ministers … Mid-morning, the team will sit with me for my telly time. Unfortunately, today we switched on and Farage was unveiling a plan for mass deportations. According to Nigel, who looked tired, he’s going to deport all immigrants who arrived here illegally. Hundreds of thousands of people, and if they don’t agree immediately then they’ll be imprisoned at military sites before being expelled. I’m stunned. That is genuinely horrible – for me. “Why didn’t any of you lot think of that?” I scream at the team. “How am I supposed to outflank him on immigration if he keeps advancing his army? He’s halfway across the Polish border by now!” There’s a short silence. “You could deport all immigrants,” says one. “Except your wife,” says another. “You could,” says a third, “think of a tougher and more eye-catching name for the internment camps.” “Like what?” I snap. But they all look at their shoes. That’s the trouble with this generation – no concentration. The afternoon is taken up with the standard work of a modern MP and public servant – running through tweet ideas and workshopping a banterious text to JD Vance. Then, I power the Range Rover home for dinner as a father of daughters. When Nigel’s tucking into the post-prandials, I’m tucking myself in. We all need a hinterland, as I tweet just before falling asleep.

    "essence": "New Orleans ‘You had to fend for yourself’: Hurricane Katrina haunts New Orleans as Trump guts disaster aid As survivors and experts reflect on the storm 20 years on, fear is growing that the US is just as unprepared to take on extreme weather amid cuts to Fema Dharna Noor in New Orleans with photographs by Thalia Juarez Tue 26 Aug 2025 13.30 CEST Last modified on Tue 26 Aug 2025 15.24 CEST Share View image in fullscreen Darren McKinney, the field operations director of lowernine.org, takes a break during a shift repairing a neighbor’s home in New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward on 20 August 2025. Darren McKinney grew up in New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward. When Hurricane Katrina struck 20 years ago this week, he watched his neighborhood wash away. From his second floor apartment, he saw flood waters rise up to his window. “I had no food at all, no water, no electricity,” he recounted one rainy day this month, while taking a break from his job leading home restoration in the neighborhood as field operations director of the non-profit lowernine.org. After being trapped inside for four days, city officials rescued McKinney in a boat and dropped him off on a nearby bridge. He was told a military truck would bring him to an emergency shelter in the city’s superdome, but a vehicle never arrived because the shelter reached capacity. He was forced to walk to an evacuation point downtown. “You had to fend for yourself,” he said. “There just wasn’t enough shelter, wasn’t enough support.” Friends helped McKinney evacuate to Houston, Texas. Months later, when he returned to the city, he found his home in “real bad condition”. He eventually settled into a trailer provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). During his stay in the temporary home, he began to hear news reports that some Fema trailers were found to have high levels of the harmful chemical formaldehyde. With nowhere else to stay, he tried to ignore those reports. “What could you do?” he asked. The federal response to Katrina, particularly by Fema, came under intense scrutiny after the hurricane, which killed at least 1,833 people. In New Orleans, residents spray-painted curses at Fema on their boarded-up homes and wore T-shirts around the city that bore the slogan: “FEMA – Federal Employees Missing in Action.” Some on the right have called to shrink the agency or even abolish it. In recent months, the Trump administration has picked up on those calls, defunding key Fema programs, laying off hundreds of staffers , and threatening to dismantle the agency completely. But McKinney believes the administration’s policies will leave New Orleans worse prepared for future hurricanes. “You don’t know when you’re gonna have another disaster like that,” he said. “For people that don’t have money, without Fema, how you going to help them out?” In recent weeks, Donald Trump has walked back promises to abolish Fema. But disaster management experts fear the changes he has made will still leave the US just as underprepared to take on a hurricane like Katrina as it was in 2005. “It has been so demoralizing to realize how closely aligned we have become again to what Fema looked like pre-Katrina, and how quickly we’ve backslid on the progress of the last 20 years,” said Samantha Montano, a disaster response expert at Massachusetts Maritime Academy and author of the book Disasterology. an aerial view New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward showing various houses and structures by a body of water An aerial view of New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward, one of the hardest-hit areas by Katrina, where damaged homes and vacant lots can still be seen 20 years later on 21 August 2025. Fema cuts could have particularly negative implications for poor, climate-vulnerable states like Louisiana. ‘State-led, federally supported’ Since re-entering the White House in January, Trump has repeatedly called for states to bear more responsibility for disasters, signing a March executive order saying municipalities should “play a more active and significant role” in national resilience and preparedness. “If they can’t handle it, they shouldn’t be governor,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in June, as he spoke about a plan to “wean” states off Fema assistance. But states have always led disaster response, said Craig Fugate, who directed Fema from 2009-2017. “The current administration says states should lead, we should support, [but] that’s what it’s always been,” he said. “The federal government, at the direction of the president, through Fema, supports the governor.” Cuts at Fema could have particularly negative implications for poor, climate-vulnerable states like Louisiana, which received the most direct assistance from Fema between January 2015 and April 2024, according to data collected for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Disaster Dollar Database. Dried up flowers on a memorial marker alongside an image of a damaged gome Dried up flowers are seen on a memorial marker for victims of Hurricane Katrina along the levee wall in the Lower Ninth Ward on 20 August 2025. Damaged homes and vacant lots are seen in New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward in August, two decades following Hurricane Katrina, a catastrophic event that resulted in the loss of at least 1,833 lives. “For states that are oftentimes underresourced, Fema gives the support that is needed to navigate disasters, both in the form of financial assistance and providing technical expertise,” said Reggie Ferreira, who directs the disaster resilience leadership academy at Tulane University in New Orleans . But even wealthier states will probably struggle to weather disasters without the agency’s support, said Montano. “The importance of Fema really just can’t be overstated. They’re the last line of defense that we really have in moments of crisis,” she said. “We know that our state and local capacity to respond to disasters in most parts of the country is relatively limited. And we know that our needs related to disasters are increasing in the context of climate change.” ‘Brain drain’ After Katrina struck New Orleans in August 2005, the support Fema was able to provide had dwindled due to policies enacted by former president George W Bush. “When Katrina happened, it’s really important to remember that Fema had just gone through a shock of their own,” said Montano. “Going into Katrina, Fema was deeply unprepared as an agency, which is a huge reason for the failure in the response.” In the wake of the 2001 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration launched a government-wide reorganization to focus on the threat of terrorism, cutting disaster programs and, in 2003, stripping Fema of its independent, cabinet-level status. The agency was then absorbed into the newly created Department of Homeland Security. “The attention was only on terrorism at the expense of anything else,” said Fugate. The shifts at Fema led to a mass exodus of staff . Some – including senior leadership – were relieved of their duties and reassigned to terrorism-related posts, while others who were reportedly frustrated with the restructure resigned. That “brain drain” was a key reason that Fema was not able to provide an adequate response to Katrina, said Montano. side by side images of an area in New Orleans in 2005 and in 2025 Aerial images of New Orleans after flooding from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, compared to 2025. Fugate said what is happening at the agency today is “very similar” to that moment. Under Trump, an estimated one-third of Fema’s workforce has been eliminated due to layoffs, firings and voluntary buyouts. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has also reportedly sent some remaining Fema staff to help speed the hiring of immigration enforcement agents. Lt Gen Russel Honoré, who led the military response to Hurricane Katrina, had choice words about the decision. “That adds insult to injury,” he said. “I really think these fucking people are stuck on stupid.” The staffing cuts threaten the relationships between state and federal officials, said Stephen Murphy, former planning section chief for New Orleans’s homeland security and emergency preparedness office. That could make disaster response less efficient. “When you have a strong team, a network, everybody has built trust in one another because they’ve been out there together, they’ve bled for one another,” said Murphy, who now leads Tulane University’s disaster management program. “When you disrupt that, you’re playing with fire.” View image in fullscreen Stephen Murphy, former planning section chief for New Orleans’s homeland security and emergency preparedness office poses for a portrait on 21 August 2025 at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. Photograph: Thalia Juarez/The Guardian The federal changes are difficult to witness, said Murphy, who said Katrina inspired his career in disaster response. When it struck, he had moved to New Orleans only six weeks earlier to pursue a graduate degree in bioterrorism . Classes had not even started when, as Katrina was gaining strength over the Gulf of Mexico, he decided to evacuate his new home. “As I was pulling out of my neighborhood, some new friends that I’d met in town said: ‘Hey, where are you going? We’re going to have a party,’” he remembered from his New Orleans office. “I had my kayak in my truck, and I asked: ‘OK, you want me to leave this for you?’ I didn’t realize how terrible a joke that would be.” In its aftermath, Murphy decided to devote his life to better managing disasters like Katrina, as did many others in the field. “There’s been tremendous improvements and growth since then,” said Murphy. “To dismantle a lot of what has been done does feel like a little bit of a gut punch.” Cutting funding, undercutting progress After Katrina, Fema also increased funding for disaster relief and mitigation. But under Trump, billions of those dollars have dried up. “A lot of the federal grants and money that helped fortify some of the most vulnerable areas, including New Orleans, are getting clawed back,” said Murphy. “You can’t just turn the spigot off and expect the system to still work.” View image in fullscreen Brett Halstead, Darren McKinnney, and Meg Gonzalez, with the non-profit lowernine.org, prepare a home for roof repairs in New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward on 20 August 2025. In the absence of federal support after Katrina, many advocacy groups worked to fill the gaps, particularly in low-income communities of color. Some of the Trump administration’s actions at Fema directly violate policies enacted by lawmakers to prevent future botched disaster responses, said Honoré. That includes the president’s January appointment of a new administrator for the agency. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, which Congress passed in 2006, requires all Fema administrators to have experience in disaster management. The provision was inspired by Bush’s Fema administrator Michael Brown, who was critiqued for his limited background in the field. In the 19 years since the bill’s passage, only “seasoned emergency managers” have succeeded Brown, said Honoré. But that all changed when Trump picked David Richardson – who appears to have no disaster management experience – for the post, he said. Before leading Fema, Richardson oversaw a Department of Homeland Security program focused on weapons of mass destruction. In a June briefing, Richardson told personnel he was unaware that the US had a hurricane season, which the White House later said was a “joke”. The 2006 policy also empowered Fema to act with greater flexibility and clearer authority in emergency management, and designated its administrator as a principal presidential adviser. Trump does not appear to be following those provisions, Honoré said. As deadly floods overwhelmed Texas last month, Fema officials told CNN they were not able to pre-position search and rescue crews in the region because Trump’s homeland security secretary Kristi Noem insisted upon personally approving all agency contracts and grants over $100,000 before funds were disbursed. “Genius,” Honoré said sarcastically. This week, Fema employees wrote to Congress warning that the Trump administration’s changes at the agency could lead to another “catastrophe” on the scale of Hurricane Katrina. “The agency’s current trajectory reflects a clear departure from the intent” of the 2006 legislation,” they wrote.

Photograph: Thalia Juarez/The Guardian Daniel Llargués, Fema’s acting press secretary, dismissed the criticisms voiced in the letter telling the New York Times the Trump administration “is committed to ensuring Fema delivers for the American people” and to cutting “red tape, inefficiency and outdated processes” in the agency. Fema did not respond to questions from the Guardian for this article. Equity threatened In the absence of federal support after Katrina, many advocacy groups worked to fill the gaps, particularly in the low-income communities of color that found it disproportionately difficult to rebuild . Even those non-governmental efforts have been undermined by Trump’s policies, said McKinney, the field operations director of lowernine.org . The organization has for years hosted international volunteers, but fewer want to travel to the US amid Trump’s immigration crackdown, he said. In May, the president also gutted AmeriCorps, leaving lowernine.org with fewer hands to help with their home construction efforts. “They cut the AmeriCorps funding [one] afternoon in the middle of a workday,” said Laura Paul, executive director of lowernine.org. “Our team had just taken a wall down on someone’s house that they were living in, and they just put their tools down and walked off site.” View image in fullscreen Laura Paul, a resident of the Lower Ninth Ward and the executive director of lowernine.org, poses for a portrait in the neighborhood on 20 August 2025, in New Orleans, Louisiana. She leads a team of volunteers and staff focused on long-term recovery efforts in the Lower Ninth Ward. Trump has also ended grants to some environmental justice groups, including in New Orleans , further threatening efforts to promote equitable disaster recovery, while gutting Biden-era equity-focused government initiatives , including within Fema. “Fema, obviously, was not perfect in any way after Katrina,” said Montano. “But a lot of the progress on equity is just gone.” ‘More support, more help’ The scrutiny federal disaster response has received since Katrina is warranted, but Trump has moved in the wrong direction, said Betina James, a resident of New Orleans’s Hollygrove neighborhood. View image in fullscreen Betina James, a resident of New Orleans’s Hollygrove neighborhood, at the Life Transformation Community Center of Celebration Church on 21 August 2025. “We want more support, more help, not for them to take all that help away,” she said. From a senior citizens community meeting at the Hollygrove-Dixon Neighborhood Association’s Life Transformation Community Center this month, James recounted her experience after Katrina destroyed her house: Fema denied her request for a temporary shelter for two months, and when they finally approved it, the agency provided her with a trailer that had “no floor in the bedroom”. “It was just covered with carpet with nothing under it, so if you stepped on it, you’d go straight through to the ground,” she said. Officials provided a replacement, but living in it made her feel nauseated with burning eyes and itchy skin. She believes it was contaminated. At the senior citizens meeting, a dozen other residents chimed in with their harrowing Katrina experiences: stepping over human corpses in the streets and being left without shelter and financial aid. Some said they have even failed to receive adequate assistance during more recent disasters such as 2021’s Hurricane Ida. View image in fullscreen Terry Caesar during a meeting at the Life Transformation Community Center on 21 August 2025. But those experiences should push officials to improve Fema, not gut it, said Terry Caesar, another senior attending the meeting. “It used to be when things broke, we took it to the shop to fix it,” he said. “You’re not supposed to throw it out.”",

    "essence": "Trump orders removal of Federal Reserve governor 2 hours ago Share Save Stuart Lau BBC News Peter Hoskins Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Reuters Cook is one of seven members of the Fed's board of governors and the first African American woman to serve in the role US President Donald Trump has said he will immediately remove Federal Reserve official Lisa Cook from her position, in a major escalation in his battle against the US central bank. He said there was \"sufficient reason\" to believe Cook had made false statements on mortgage agreements, and cited constitutional powers which he said allowed him to remove her. In response, Cook said Trump had no authority to fire her and she would not resign. It is an unprecedented move for the president to dismiss a member of the central bank's leadership, and comes as Trump has put increasing pressure on the Fed - especially its chair Jerome Powell - over what he sees as an unwillingness to lower interest rates. Who is Lisa Cook, and what is Federal Reserve governor accused of? Watch: Trump jokes he wants Powell to lower interest rates in awkward exchange Cook is one of seven members of the Fed's board of governors, and in this position sits on the 12-member committee which is responsible for setting interest rates in the US. The US president nominates candidates for this role, so removing Ms Cook would mean she could be replaced by someone more favourable to lower interest rates and to the Trump economic agenda. The Fed's decision affects the rate at which Americans can borrow money as well as the savings rates on their bank accounts. US interest rates are also closely watched by central banks who set monetary policy in other countries. Cook voted alongside Powell and most other members of the committee to maintain US interest rates at the Fed's last rate-setting meeting at the end of July . She was appointed by Trump's predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, in 2022 and is the first African American woman to serve in the role. Trump's decision to remove her will likely raise legal questions, with experts suggesting the White House will need to demonstrate - potentially in court - that it had sufficient reason to fire her. The president's conflict with Cook and Powell - whom Trump has suggested he wants to fire for not cutting interest rates fast enough - also raises questions about the Fed's independence from politics. Many economists believe the Fed and other central banks need independence in order to make financial policy in the public's interest. Cook said in a statement that Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so\". \"I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,\" she added. Cook's lawyer Abbe David Lowell said: \"We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent [Trump's] attempted illegal action.\" The Federal Reserve has not yet commented on the president's",

    "essence": "TfL asks 'nuisance' mobile users to wear headphones 2 hours ago Share Save Aurelia Foster BBC News Share Save Getty Images Watching films and making calls using loudspeakers is \"disruptive\" to others, TfL says Transport for London (TfL) is targeting the \"disruptive behaviour\" of passengers who play music and make calls using mobile phone loudspeakers. TfL said most bus and Tube travellers considered such behaviour \"a nuisance\" and that some even found the additional noise very stressful. The new campaign follows TfL research that found 70% of 1,000 passengers surveyed said they found films, music and calls being played on loudspeakers to be a nuisance. Posters urging passengers to use headphones or hands-free kits with their device will appear on the Elizabeth line from Tuesday and across other services from the autumn. TfL said it can use its powers to enforce existing by-laws which ban the playing of music or watching content when it causes distress annoyance to others. During the Monday morning rush hour BBC Radio London spoke to commuters, who backed the message of the campaign. One said: \"It should be banned, definitely. It is not polite to anyone else when you are sat on the Tube in the morning and someone is playing music. That's horrendous. It is not comfortable.\" Another said: \"Maybe someone might be working or they might be tired so yes I think it should be banned. I personally don't mind but I know that other people are a bit more mindful about that. I guess you have to respect what other people think.\" A third commuter said: \"Recently on a train there was a woman she was playing quite loud [music] and I was smiling to her trying to give the idea that not everyone could like that music. She didn't care.\" 'Unpleasant and stressful' Loudspeaker noise can be especially acute for those with heightened sensitivity, such as people with autism. Emma Strain, TfL's customer director, told BBC Radio London that TfL by-laws prohibit playing music and streaming content out loud without permission. She added: \"When our enforcement officers encounter someone doing this they usually ask the person to stop. \"Most people comply at that stage, but if someone refuses then further enforcement action can be taken, which might include them being asked to leave the service or the station, or being reported for possible prosecution.\" The new posters will be accompanied by Instagram posts. Passengers will also be asked to look up from their screens in case someone else needs their seat more, said TfL. Posters will appear on the Elizabeth line first and other parts of the network from the autumn In February, a man was fined €200 (£172) for making a call on loudspeaker in a designated quiet area of a French train station.

    "essence": "Who is Lisa Cook, and what is Federal Reserve governor accused of? 3 hours ago Share Save Tom Geoghegan and James FitzGerald BBC News Share Save Getty Images President Donald Trump has demanded the removal of one of the governors of the US central bank, a move that escalates his long-running feud with the institution. Late on Monday, he posted on his Truth Social account a letter addressed to Lisa Cook, saying she was being removed from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors due to mortgage fraud allegations. The move has caused an outcry from Democrats who say it amounts to unprecedented political interference. Who is Lisa Cook and what does she do? Ms Cook was appointed as governor of the Federal Reserve in 2022 by Democratic President Joe Biden, becoming the first African American to serve in the role. Her term was due to end in 2038. She previously served on Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers and worked at the US Treasury. There are seven governors on the board of the Fed and they play a key role in setting the monetary policy of the US. They make up the majority of the committee that decides the level of US interest rates and aims to keep prices stable and unemployment as low as possible. Ms Cook has voted in recent months to keep interest rates on hold this year. Full story: Trump orders removal of Cook Fed governor says she won't be 'bullied' Powell boosts expectation of US rate cut What has Trump accused Lisa Cook of? In his Truth Social post, the president cited allegations that Ms Cook may have falsified records to obtain a mortgage. He said she signed two documents, two weeks apart, attesting that two homes in different states were both her primary residence. \"It is inconceivable that you were not aware of your first commitment when making the second. It is impossible that you intended to honor both,\" he wrote. CNN has obtained and reviewed the mortgage documents in question and found she did claim two primary residences but it is unclear whether she informed either lender of the fact. Ms Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing and in statement she said she would fight her dismissal because Trump did not have just cause to fire her. What does the Fed do? As the central bank of the US, the Federal Reserve is responsible for running the nation's monetary policy, promoting stability in the financial system, regulating institutions and other tasks. One of the most visible activities it undertakes is to set interest rates. This has a big impact on the nation's financial conditions by influencing how much money people can borrow. The Fed functions as a federal agency and is considered to be independent within government - its decisions do not require the president's approval, though it is accountable to Congress. Can Trump actually fire her? This question could become the subject of an intense legal battle. The Federal Reserve Act does not give the president license to remove a Fed official at will but, as Trump noted in his l",

    "essence": "Domestic abuse screening tool doesn't work, minister says 4 hours ago Share Save Leila Nathoo, political correspondent & Daniel Kraemer File on 4 Investigates Share Save PA Media Jess Phillips said authorities must make best of system they have until a better one is found The main screening tool used to decide which domestic abuse victims get urgent support \"doesn't work\", Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips has admitted to the BBC. Police, social services and healthcare workers across the UK have largely relied on the Dash questionnaire to assess risk since 2009. But there are now mounting concerns from academics and those working in the sector that the checklist does not correctly identify victims at the highest risk of further harm. Phillips told the BBC's File on 4 that she was reviewing the entire system supporting victims but said it wouldn't \"change overnight\". The Dash (Domestic, Abuse, Stalking, Harassment and Honour-Based Violence) assessment is a list of 27 questions put to victims, to 24 of which they answer yes, no or don't know. The questions include things like: \"Has the current incident resulted in injury?\" and \"is the abuse getting worse?\" The resulting score typically determines what happens next. If a victim is classified as \"high\" risk, they are referred on for specialist, intensive support. There were 108 domestic homicides in England and Wales in the year to March 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics. Now, families of women who were murdered after not being graded as high risk are exploring legal action against the institutions they believe failed their loved ones. Jess Phillips, whose remit also covers violence against women and girls, admitted there were \"obvious problems\" with the Dash questionnaire, but said: \"Until I can replace it with something that does [work] we have to make the very best of the system that we have.\" She added that she \"really hate[d]\" the idea that a \"perfect\" form could be created because \"risk is dynamic. It could be... different 20 minutes later\". Practitioners also needed to be trained to understand that risk can change, she said. \"Any risk assessment tool is only as good as the person who is using it.\" Phillips said people were killed even when deemed to be at high risk, adding: \"The grading system won't immediately protect you… It is the systems that flow from those risk assessments that matter much, much, much more than the score.\" Lawyer Matthew Jury, whose firm has been approached by relatives, told the BBC: \"These aren't just statistics, they're preventable tragedies and it leaves families devastated when risks are inadequately assessed and victims are left exposed.\" The Home Office is now reviewing how all agencies handle domestic abuse cases - including risk assessments - as part of its wider strategy to tackle violence against women and girls, which is expected to be published in the autumn. Multiple academic studies, some dating back almost a decade, have looked into ",

    "essence": "Sport Insight 'People looked at me like I was a something, not someone' Published 4 hours ago Image source, Getty Images Elizabeth Conway BBC Sport \"I didn't look in a mirror for years - maybe four or five years,\" former England and Team GB forward Heather Fisher says matter-of-factly. \"Looking back, I felt disgusting because people look at you like you're a something, not someone.\" She is explaining how she came to terms with losing her hair, the battles she has faced with her identity and the struggle for acceptance from others. Sitting in her living room, it is impossible to miss a white wall adorned in black handwriting. Take a closer look, and you see there are hundreds of motivational quotes and personal affirmations. The words tell a story even before she begins to share hers. 'May feel lost'. 'May feel uncomfortable'. 'All part of the transition'. They are just a few of them. Image source, BBC Sport Image caption, Fisher's living room wall is full of handwritten messages Fisher retired as an England player four years ago after a career mainly spent as a flanker that spanned more than a decade and also included a cameo in bobsleigh. She was part of the Red Roses squad that won the Women's World Cup in 2014, and played rugby sevens as well. She competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics - where Great Britain lost in the bronze medal match - and for England at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Australia's Gold Coast. But some of her toughest battles happened off the pitch. In the countdown to the 2010 Rugby World Cup, her hair began to fall out. It is believed to have been triggered by a serious back injury. Just over a month later, it had all gone and Fisher was diagnosed with alopecia, an auto-immune condition that destroys the hair follicles. \"All my hair fell out in about five weeks. I was holding on to strands of hair,\" she recalls. \"I went to camp with my team-mates and my coaches actually shaved my hair off.\" 'As a female, I don't ever feel like I fitted in' To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. This video can not be played Media caption, 'I've had wigs thrown at me' What followed was not just a physical change but a confrontation with her new identity. \"I've always struggled with my alopecia. Losing my hair and looking and feeling different\", the 41-year-old explains. \"As a female, I don't ever feel like I fitted in.\" Fisher tried to wear wigs but they never felt authentic. \"It felt like I was hiding and I didn't want to hide,\" she says. \"I felt like I had to be brave and I had to own it. But that's not easy. I was in an England system where I didn't feel like I could be myself.\" It was not just internal struggles she faced - it was how others responded to her appearance. \"I've had wigs thrown at me. I've been about to go and play and had wigs thrown at me outside of the pitch,\" Fisher recalls. \"I've been asked why I'm about to go and play on a pitch with females when I'm a guy. Quite clearly, I'm not a guy. I've been physically poked out of toilets.\" These experiences left deep scars that Fisher is still working through. \"I think when you're an athlete, you're a role model to so many people and you're just supposed to take the hits,\" she adds. \"But I think on reflection, I don't see why I should be poked out of toilets. I don't see why police are waiting to check what I am. I've only had the time to reflect on it since retiring and stepping back.\" 'We don't understand muscles and no hair' Fisher believes the sporting world has made modest strides in embracing women of all shapes and sizes and those with differences, with rugby seen as one of the most inclusive sports. Social media platforms, particularly TikTok, have played a significant role in shifting perceptions, allowing athletes to tell their own stories and highlighting the ways they break the mould. Reflecting on her own career, Fisher notes how different the landscape was even a few years ago. Social media presence was in its infancy when she was playing. If you worked on your profile, \"you were almost seen as not taking the sport seriously,\" she adds. But that has changed now. \"If I was playing now for sure, I would definitely share my story on social media. It would turn heads and it would be a real positive way to showcase the game and showcase someone who looks and feels different,\" she says. Among the athletes redefining what it means to be a woman in sport is United States superstar Ilona Maher. She is the most followed rugby player - male or female - in the world, with millions of followers on TikTok and Instagram thanks to content that celebrates her strength and femininity. \"I think with Ilona Maher, it's really interesting because she's done such a great job,\" Fisher says. \"She's a great advocate for what she puts out there and she's brilliant. But she still looks very feminine.\" Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Fisher played at the Rugby World Cup, the Commonwealth Games and the Olympics Fisher says, by contrast, she feels she does not look feminine - and that is where the issue lies. \"We can put a woman out there and they might have muscles and they might have a certain way of looking, but they still look feminine,\" she explains. \"We accept women who are muscular and we understand muscles and women. \"But we don't understand muscles and no hair.\" Since retirement, Fisher has forged a career as a motivational speaker, a rugby pundit and a leadership consultant. She has also appeared on Channel 4's 'Celebrity SAS Who Dares Wins' and the BBC's 'Go Hard or Go Home'. And given the choice to have a full head of hair again, she would not want to change who she is. \"I'd be able to do a hair flick but it would do my head in and it would make me itchy so I wouldn't change it. It's made me who I am today,\" she says, with pride. \"It's made me really resilient and I really, truly believe that I was born to stand out.\" Related topics Insight: In-depth stories from the world of sport Rugby Union More on this story Listen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate Listen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "essence": "Manhunt under way after two police officers shot dead in rural Australian town 5 hours ago Share Save Jaroslav Lukiv BBC News Share Save Officers were 'murdered in cold blood', Victoria Police chief says A huge manhunt is under way for a \"heavily armed\" male suspect after two Australian police officers were shot dead and one injured in an ambush at a property in a small rural town in the state of Victoria. Police described the situation in Porepunkah in the Australian Alps - some 300km (186 miles) north-east of Melbourne - as an \"active incident\" with hundreds of personnel deployed to find the suspect. Officers were attacked as 10 of them attended the property to serve an arrest warrant, which Australian media said was for historical sex offences. Police say the suspect escaped by running into the bush alone after the shooting. Officers are still trying to find the man's wife and children. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Mike Bush said that 10 officers went to the property on Tuesday at about 10:30 local time (00:30 GMT). They were fired upon by a heavily armed offender, he said, adding that two colleagues - a 59-year-old detective and a 35-year-old senior constable - were \"murdered in cold blood\". A third officer was shot in the lower body. He was airlifted to hospital and was undergoing surgery, Mr Bush said. His injuries are not life-threatening. The state police chief said all the available resources were being used in the manhunt for a \"dangerous\" suspect, and urged locals to stay indoors. \"[Our] priority is to arrest him and bring safety and security to this community,\" the officer said. He added that the suspect was believed to have been on his own at the time of the shooting, and that police \"are still looking to locate his partner and two children, but he was not seen to head into the bush with them\". He said the fact that so many officers were attending, highlighted that they knew the risks - and urged the gunman to give himself up. The police chief did not confirm the nature of the raid that officers were executing at the property. Footage from the scene earlier on Tuesday showed dozens of police deployed to Porepunkah and a police helicopter circling in the area. The town, home to about 1,000 people, is part of the Alpine Shire local government area. People have been warned not to travel into the area. In a statement, Mayor Sarah Nicholas paid tribute to the officers, extending \"thoughts, love and unwavering\" support to their families. \"Today has been a day of deep sorrow and shock for our community... We are grieving together,\" she said. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan both praised the officers for their bravery. Local resident Emily White told the BBC she and her guests had been sheltering in a caravan park that she owned. \"I think reality really set in - that this is a really, really horrible situation,\" Ms White said. \"We're such a small community, and we'll leave our cars unlocked, and we'll leave our front doors open. Nothing like this ever happens.\" Local media are naming the suspect as Dezi Freeman - who claims to be a \"sovereign citizen\" - which refers to someone who falsely believes they are not subject to Australian laws and government authority. Called SovCits for short, these people have been a presence in the nation for decades, according to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The police say they are mostly harmless, but there has been a resurgence of the beliefs in recent years - in part fuelled by mistrust in authorities which was exacerbated by the Covid pandemic. In a 2023 briefing note, the AFP said the movement had \"an underlying capacity to inspire violence\". Gun crime is relatively rare in Australia, which has some of the world's strictest gun regulations. But similarities are being drawn with an ambush attack in 2022, when two police officers were killed at a rural property in Queensland. Victoria Australia",

Opta's statistics indicate the ball was in play for 40.8% of the match - the lowest percentage in a Premier League match since February 2010. \"I'm not too sure if I saw a football match,\" Slot told Sky Sports after the game. \"It was set-piece after set-piece, long throws. It didn't have a lot to do with tactics. But I liked a lot how we stood strong.\" The match was played out against the backdrop of Alexander Isak's desire to leave Newcastle for Liverpool, which contributed to a feisty atmosphere inside the stadium. That translated onto the pitch, with Newcastle's Anthony Gordon shown a red card for a rash challenge on Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk shortly before half-time. There were 32 fouls in total - the most in a Premier League game so far this season. \"It was a very difficult first half hour, 45 minutes. We didn't collapse at all and went 1-0 up,\" said Slot. \"Newcastle going down to 10 men, you would expect is a big plus for us but when a goalkeeper takes every free-kick, there is not much hope [benefit] if you are one player up. That's why it was so difficult to bring the 2-0 over the line.\" To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

    "essence": "Rising egg prices push food inflation to 18-month high 5 hours ago Share Save Amy Walker & Mitchell Labiak Reporters, BBC News Share Save Getty Images The rising cost of chocolate, butter and eggs has helped drive food price inflation to its highest in 18 months, a survey says. Food inflation hit 4.2% in the year to August, up from 4% in July, according to the British Retail Consortium's latest shop price monitor. It said food prices were rising at the fastest rate since February of last year. The figure echoes separate recent data from the Office for National Statistics, which found the cost of everyday food items rising by a similar amount over the last year . Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive, said there was some respite for parents as the new academic year approaches, with cheaper clothing, books and stationery. Ms Dickinson said staples including butter and eggs had seen \"significant increases\" due to high demand, tightening supply and increased labour costs. \"Chocolate also got more expensive as global prices of cocoa remain high owing to poor harvests,\" she said. Poor cocoa harvests have been caused by climate change and crop disease . \"There was some respite for parents ahead of the new academic year, with lower prices for clothing, books, stationery, and computing.\" Chocolate costs soar as times get tough for producers Why are food prices still rising by so much? High meat and tea costs drive up food prices Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NIQ, which compiles the BRC's shop price monitor, said the uptick reflected \"several factors\". These included global supply costs, seasonal food inflation driven by weather conditions and a rise in underlying operational costs. \"As shoppers return from their summer holidays, many may need to reassess household budgets in response to rising household bills,\" he added. 'We've had to take some products off our menu' Kate Rumsey, owner of Rumsey's Chocolaterie in Thame, Oxfordshire, said chocolate inflation had been \"consistently high\" for a couple of years. Her business bought chocolate at around £4,000 a tonne in 2023 but prices have since trebled to about £13,000 a tonne. The shop has also been hit by higher staff costs, as well as ingredients, such as eggs and butter, becoming more expensive. Ms Rumsey said the business absorbed most of the higher costs, but added she had to pass some costs onto customers, with prices up 10 to 20% depending on the product. In some cases, she said the business had removed some products off its menu due to them becoming too expensive to produce. Increasing food prices added to increase in overall inflation in the year to July . The latest official figures from the ONS put UK inflation - as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) - at 3.8%, up from 3.6% in June. Looking over the longer term, the picture is even more stark. In the five years to July, food prices increased by around 37%. That compares with a rise of 4.4% over the previous five-year period.

    "essence": "Meghan on who said 'I love you' first, and what she misses about UK 6 hours ago Share Save Noor Nanji Culture reporter • @NoorNanji Share Save Netflix Californian sunsets, perfectly decorated cakes, and lessons in how to make salt and vinegar crisps. That's right - With Love, Meghan, is back. Series two of the TV series, which drops on Netflix on Tuesday, was once again filmed in a house close to the Duchess of Sussex's home in Montecito. Celebrity friends such as Chrissy Teigan and John Legend pop by for food. And we get a glimpse into what Meghan's family life is like, although the Duke of Sussex, and their children Archie and Lilibet, do not appear in it themselves. Take mornings, for example. In one episode, Meghan reveals she makes hot breakfast for her family most days. \"It's not as complicated as people think it is,\" she says. \"It feels like a big undertaking but you're just slicing bread, you're dunking it in some eggs, and calling it a day.\" Meghan's divisiveness may well work to her advantage When questioned on this by her guest, Queer Eye's Tan France, she elaborates on what she likes to cook. \"Fried eggs and pancakes, but I like to do surprise pancakes for the kids, so I always put some ground flax seeds, pour some chia seeds in. And Lili will ask me, 'Can I have chia seeds? I want it to have freckles',\" she says. \"The ritual of breakfast is a sacred time as a family,\" she adds. \"You just take a minute of calm before the day.\" If that's nothing like what your mornings resemble, don't worry. Many of us are lucky if we find time to scoff down some cereal before work. But the whole point of Meghan's series is that it's aspirational. It's optimistic. And it's relentlessly upbeat, throughout all of its episodes. Harry said 'I love you' first Like the first instalment, series two sees Meghan share cooking, gardening and hosting tips with friends and famous guests. Nuggets about her life, love and interests are scattered throughout. We hear that as an aspiring actress, Meghan - who went on to star in Suits - used to get so nervous from auditions she would get blotchy and have to wear turtlenecks. When an audition went well, she would treat herself with a McDonald's apple pie. She knew she loved Harry by date three, when the pair were camping in Botswana. He said ‘I love you’ first. They eat a lot of roast chicken. But Harry's less adventurous palate also gets a mention. When cooking a meal with chef José Andrés, Meghan reveals that her husband doesn't like lobster. \"No way,\" says Andrés. \"And you married him?\" But the show is as much about what's not in it, as what is. The Royal Family don't get a mention, nor is there any discussion of the rift within it. Earlier this year , Harry gave an emotional interview to BBC News in which he said he \"would love a reconciliation\" with his family, but none of that is on display here. In fact, Harry doesn't appear on camera at all in the series. Nor do their children. The couple continue to protect Archie and Lilibet's privacy, while also presenting their lifestyle. There are no references to their former lives as working royals. We do, however, learn what Meghan misses most about the UK. The answer? Magic Radio. \"Sorry to say this to you publicly but that's such a grandma station,\" says Tan France. \"I'll be that grandma,\" replies Meghan. Meghan’s new lifestyle empire Netflix Meghan's TV series features a number of celebrity guests, including model Chrissy Teigen With Love, Meghan, has widely been seen as the Duchess' relaunch, as she builds her new lifestyle empire. Despite it being the tenth most watched Netflix programme globally in its first week, audiences gave the first series a rating of just 32% on the film and television review website, Rotten Tomatoes (based on more than 2,500 votes). Reviews were mixed. The Guardian described it as a \"gormless lifestyle filler\" while The Telegraph gave it two stars and branded it \"insane\" and an \"exercise in narcissism\". However, the BBC's royal correspondent Sean Coughlan wrote that it was about \"escapism\" , adding: \"It's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day.\" The TV show was followed by the launch of Meghan's new brand As Ever, selling, among other things, edible flower petals and jars of wildflower honey. Next up came her podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder. And earlier this month, Prince Harry and Meghan signed a new multi-year deal for films and TV shows with Netflix. It's a looser arrangement than their previous deal - but it disproves claims that the Sussexes and Netflix are going to completely part company. Royal expert Victoria Murphy says that for Meghan personally, her TV show is “very important... in terms of how she wants to be seen and the kind of public presence that she wants to have moving forward”. And, as with everything Meghan does, reactions to part two of her series are likely to be mixed. If you don't like Meghan, you're probably not going to like this. But if you're a Meghan fan, you'll love it. All smiles in Meghan's upbeat Netflix series Meghan's divisiveness may well work to her advantage Harry and Meghan sign new multi-year Netflix deal Media Television Culture UK Royal Family Meghan, Duchess of Sussex Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex The Royal Family and the media Netflix",
