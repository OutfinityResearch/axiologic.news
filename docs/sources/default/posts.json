This model offers significantly improved accuracy (88%) and broader applicability for the general population compared to existing methods like FIB-4, enabling earlier detection of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Developed by Rickard Strandberg and Hannes Hagström, the CORE model uses 5 routine factors and was validated on 480,000 people in Stockholm, published in The BMJ on September 29, 2025.",
