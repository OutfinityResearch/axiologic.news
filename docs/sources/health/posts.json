    "essence": "Here’s a concise summary of the key findings and implications from the research: Knee osteoarthritis is a common and painful condition, but routine X-rays for diagnosis can do more harm than good. New research shows that when patients see their X-rays, they often become more anxious, fear exercise, and believe surgery is their only option—even when less invasive treatments could help. This leads to unnecessary medical costs and potential overuse of surgery.",
    "reactions": [
      "Evidence strength and limitations: The study provides strong evidence that X-rays can increase anxiety and surgical inclination in osteoarthritis patients, but its reliance on hypothetical video consultations may limit real-world applicability.",
      "Real-world application and caveats: While the findings suggest reducing X-ray use, implementing this change in clinical practice may be challenging due to patient expectations and physician habits, requiring targeted education campaigns.",
      "Health system/patient impact and next steps: Reducing unnecessary X-rays could lower healthcare costs and radiation exposure, but further research is needed to identify effective strategies for shifting both patient and provider behaviors toward clinical diagnosis."
