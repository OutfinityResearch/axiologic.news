    "essence": "Search Engine Land » SEO » Article ChatGPT’s answers came from Google Search after all: Report Published: August 26, 2025 at 11:33 am Read Time: 2 minutes Share Written by Danny Goodwin Table of Contents Table of Contents Even ChatGPT leaned on Google’s search results via a scraping service – underscoring how crucial Google’s index remains in the AI search era. Multiple tests have suggested ChatGPT is using Google Search . Well, a new report seems to confirm ChatGPT is indeed using Google Search data. OpenAI quietly used (and may still be using) a Google Search scraping service to power ChatGPT&rsquo;s answers on real-time topics like news, sports, and finance, according to The Information. The details. OpenAI used SerpApi, an 8-year-old scraping firm, to extract Google results. SerpApi reportedly listed OpenAI as a customer on its site as recently as May 2024. That listing was later removed for unknown reasons. ( Here&rsquo;s evidence via the Wayback Machine .) Google has reportedly long tried to block SerpApi&rsquo;s crawler, though it&rsquo;s unclear how effective those efforts have been. Other SerpApi customers reportedly include Meta, Apple, and Perplexity. Zoom out. This revelation contrasts with OpenAI&rsquo;s public stance that ChatGPT search relies on its own crawler, Microsoft Bing, and licensed publisher data. During Google&rsquo;s antitrust trial, ChatGPT exec Nick Turley indicated Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing had &ldquo;significant quality issues&rdquo; and indicated that Google&rsquo;s index would accelerate OpenAI&rsquo;s search ambitions. Meanwhile. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently dismissed Google Search , saying: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use Google anymore. I legitimately cannot tell you the last time I did a Google search.&rdquo; Well, based on this news, it seems like he probably is using Google Search all the time within his own product. Why we care . Google&rsquo;s search index remains the foundation of online discovery – so much so that even its biggest AI search rival appears to be using it to partially power ChatGPT. This is yet another reminder that SEO isn&rsquo;t going anywhere just yet. If Google&rsquo;s results are valuable to OpenAI, they remain essential for driving visibility, traffic, and business outcomes. The report.

YOU WILL BE BANNED. r/Advertising: Is for ad creators, students, copywriters, and anyone else who is finely honing their reverse banner blindness for professional reasons. Members Online • Appropriate_East_665 Is FBA still reliable with Random Tariffs? r/Sacrumgroup • Is FBA still reliable with Random Tariffs? The Answer is Yes and No both. Even after tariffs Amazon is just like starting any business some sellers will make a killing, others will lose money and move on. With FBA + sourcing from China, tariffs are affecting profitability, but honestly it all comes down to managing 5 key things. : 1️. The Right Product Tariffs affect the most when you’re selling in highly competitive, low-margin categories. In other words the \"Uncertain/ Low Potential Products\" ( I had an entire meeting with an expert on this category alone and there are ways out for such products as well, difficult but not impossible) A simple way to check if a product has potential: Opportunity Score = Search Volume Average ÷ Competitor Ratings If a keyword has 12,000 searches/month and top competitors average 3.7 stars: 12,000 ÷ 3.7 = 3,243 → That’s promising: Demand is there, and competitors are weak. Prefer niches where you can either: -Bear margins without cutting margins -Change Price based on premium positioning 2️. Knowing Your Profit Margins (with Tariffs) When importing from China, tariffs do affect COGS, which impacts net profit. Net Profit = (Selling Price − Amazon Fees − COGS − Shipping − Tariffs) × Units Sold Say you sell a product for $30, Amazon Fees = $8, COGS (China) = $10, Shipping = $4, Tariff = 10% of COGS = $1 Net Profit per Unit = $40 − $8 − $10 − $4 − $1 = $17 If you sell 300 units/month: $17 × 300 = $5,100/month in net profit even with tariffs applied. But if you’re working on very thin margins (<25%), tariffs will make it hard for you, so factor them in before even talking to a supplier. 3️. Budgeting for Ads (Because FBA Is Pay-to-Play Now) Even if tariffs minimize your landed cost, you can still go for it only if you keep the ad cost within your margin range. ACoS = (Ad Spend ÷ Sales Revenue) × 100 15–20% ACoS → Profitable in most categories 30%+ ACoS → Not going to be profitable. Either pricing is off or ad targeting needs fixing Test before scaling. So, start small with segmented campaigns → monitor CTR, CPC, and conversion rates before going all in with ehavy budgets. 4️. Managing Inventory Efficiently Tariffs will definitely make you rethink your order sized. If you order more stock you will incur more costs. If you understock, you lose rank and momentum. Example: • You sell 20 units/day • Supplier lead time = 30 days • Safety stock = 200 units (20 × 30) + 200 = 800 units to reorder 5️. Brand Building = Premium Pricing If tariffs minimize margins, a solid branding can help you out. With Amazon Brand Registry: -You unlock A+ Content, Brand Ads, and Video placements -You can differentiate via storytelling, leading to higher pricing -You can report hijackers and secure buy box Bottom line is FBA is still profitable even with tariffs if you know your: • Target COGS • Desired margin(after tariffs) • Inventory requirements You won’t face much issues this way. Hope this helps. Read more upvote Share",

    "essence": "Ad Hijacking Explained: Over $12 Billion Lost To Hidden Tactics Understand ad hijacking and its impact on your brand. Protect your traffic and learn to stop affiliate abuse in 2025. Bluepear 9 seconds ago ⋅ 8 min read Bluepear Bluepear Bio Follow This post was sponsored by Bluepear . The opinions expressed in this article are the sponsor&rsquo;s own. Have you ever seen an ad that looks just like your favorite brand&rsquo;s ad, but isn&rsquo;t? Ad hijacking . Ever clicked an ad expecting to reach Nike&rsquo;s website but ended up on some random store you&rsquo;d never heard of? Ad hijacking. It happens to thousands of companies that run paid ads, and you&rsquo;re not immune. More people are buying products and services online. With $6 trillion being spent by online shoppers in 2024 (CapitalOneShopping Research), the competition for ad placement is fierce. If someone hijacks your ads, you: lose traffic. lose money. lose trust. Ad hijacking harms your brand and ad performance. In This Guide: 1. What Is Ad Hijacking? 2. Secret Tactics That Are Used To Hide Ad Hijacking 3. Direct Impact Of Ad Hijacking On Your Company 4. How To Spot And Prevent Ad Hijacking 5. Modern Tools To Catch What Manual Audits Miss 6. Protect Your Brand From Ad Hijacking Learn how to detect ad hijacking , stop affiliate abuse, and protect your traffic in 2025. What Is Ad Hijacking ? Ad hijacking , by definition, is a form of advertising fraud where someone pretends to be your brand in paid search ads (like Google or other platforms). The fraudsters copy your brand name, your ad style, even your messaging, so the ad looks real. But when a customer clicks, they&rsquo;re sent somewhere else. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 There are two common types: Affiliate ad hijacking. Competitor ad hijacking. What Is Affiliate Ad Hijacking? Affiliate ad hijacking happens when partners in your affiliate program bid on your brand name. They: copy your ad (same headline, same style) so it looks like the real thing. The Result: The customer thinks they&rsquo;re clicking on your official site because the ad looks the same. But behind the scenes, the affiliate redirects the traffic through their own tracking link. You end up paying them a commission for a customer who was already looking for you. This inflates your costs, pollutes your data, and makes it harder to measure real performance. Example: A user searches for [Super Tools]. An affiliate runs an ad with the headline &ldquo;Super Tools Official Site,&rdquo; but the link is an affiliate redirect. You pay them a cut, even though they didn&rsquo;t bring in new traffic. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 What Is Competitor Ad Hijacking? Competitor ad hijacking is when a rival company copies your brand in search ads to steal your traffic. They: bid on your brand name, use ad text that looks like yours, sometimes even mimic your domain. The Result : Customers click, thinking they&rsquo;re going to your site. But instead, they land on the competitor&rsquo;s website. This tactic lets competitors capture high-intent traffic. As a result, you lose potential sales, while they gain market share. Without PPC brand protection, your brand presence can be weakened, allowing competitors to grow faster at your expense. Example: A competitor bids on &ldquo;Super Tools&rdquo; and runs a lookalike ad. The user clicks, expecting your site, but lands on the competitor&rsquo;s product page instead. You lose a sale and possibly the customer&rsquo;s trust. As you see, search hijacking is already a serious threat to your brand and budget. It&rsquo;s made even worse by how well the violators hide their tracks. Secret Tactics That Are Used To Hide Ad Hijacking Non-compliant partners use smart tactics to avoid being seen by brand owners or their teams. Here&rsquo;s how they do it: GEO targeting. Ads are shown only in specific countries, cities, or regions. If you&rsquo;re not in that area, you&rsquo;ll never see them – but your local customers will. Dayparting. Hijackers run ads at night, on weekends, or during holidays when your team is less likely to notice them. Cloaking and dynamic redirects. They use scripts to show one version of the ad or landing page to Google (to pass review) and a different one to users – usually a fake or affiliate redirect. Smaller search engines. Many hijackers avoid Google and run campaigns on Bing or other second-tier platforms, where rules are looser and tracking is weaker. Without proper hijacking prevention , these tactics make it easy for hijackers to hide and hard for your team to catch them in time. Direct Impact Of Ad Hijacking On Your Company The impact of affiliate ad hijacking goes far beyond a few stolen clicks. It damages performance, costs money, and creates serious risks for your business: Lost ad budget. You pay commissions to affiliates who didn&rsquo;t bring you new traffic; they just hijacked what was already yours. Higher CPC and more competition. Hijackers bid on your brand keywords, driving up your costs and competing against your own campaigns. Broken attribution. Without hijacking prevention, your analytics get messy. It becomes harder to measure what&rsquo;s really working because affiliate hijacking inflates performance data. Reputation damage. Users may land on shady or misleading pages. They won&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s not your site – they&rsquo;ll just stop trusting your brand. Compliance risks. If you&rsquo;re in a regulated industry (finance, health, etc.), fake ads and unapproved messaging can create legal trouble or policy violations. Search hijacking doesn&rsquo;t just hurt your numbers. It makes you question the data you rely on, wastes hours chasing false leads, and forces you to fight for traffic that was already yours. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 85% of consumers avoid buying from brands that generate unsafe experiences, and ad hijacking falls into that bucket (PwC Report). 75% of ad hijacking comes from affiliate partners exploiting tracking gaps to earn unearned commissions (Neilpatel). Up to 30% of affiliate commissions come from hijacking and similar deceptive tactics (AffiliateWP). Ad hijacking caused an estimated $12.6 billion in losses in 2023, based on 15% of the $84 billion lost to ad fraud globally (Juniper Research). How To Spot And Prevent Ad Hijacking What actually works on PPC brand protection? To uncover real issues, you need tools and methods that go beyond surface metrics: Step 1: Quick Manual Checks Run branded keyword searches and audit SERPs – look for near-identical copy linking to another domain. Watch for anomalies in performance (CPC spikes, conversion drops, affiliate surges). Review affiliate conversion patterns – unusual regional spikes may signal fraud. Geo-test with VPNs or third-party tools to uncover geo-targeted hijacks. Track impression share – sudden drops without budget changes mean new competition. Step 2: Scalable Prevention Tactics Behavioral simulation : Mimic real user searches across devices and browsers to reveal hidden hijacks. Geo-rotation & proxy use : Detect localized hijacking attempts. Proof collection : Document ads, redirects, affiliate IDs, and keywords for enforcement. Real-time alerts & auto takedown : Get notified instantly and stop fraudulent ads before they drain your budget. By combining manual checks and scalable tools, you can take control before search hijacking quietly eats into your ad spend. Modern Tools To Catch What Manual Audits Miss Manual checks can&rsquo;t keep up with how ad hijacking works today. Hijackers often run ads only in certain regions, at non-working hours, or under specific conditions. They use cloaking and redirects that can&rsquo;t be detected with regular checks. Most teams lack the time and capability to ensure hijacking prevention through manual monitoring alone. That&rsquo;s why ad hijacking tools like Bluepear are essential – as PPC brand protection software, they automate continuous scanning of search results to catch every sneaky ad trying to hijack your traffic and budget. Here&rsquo;s how Bluepear helps to fight against ad hijacking: Simulates real user behavior.

If you want to survive in a world of smart fraud, automated PPC brand protection is a must. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 Protect Your Brand From Ad Hijacking Ad hijacking quietly eats into your ad budget, distorts your performance data, and damages user trust. Manual audits rarely catch it. Hijackers use GEO targeting, dayparting, and cloaking to stay hidden while stealing high-intent traffic and commissions. Are you sure no one is hijacking your branded ads? Bluepear helps you catch what others miss. The ad hijacking tool automatically checks SERPs from different GEOs, devices, and browsers to keep your brand protected from fraud.

I’m the sole marketing person at a financial institution of about 120. 3x per month, I’m responsible for sending out our “loan bonus” email to our loan broker network. These are not small bonuses, some loan broker shops can earn over $300k a month just in bonuses. Many of these loan brokers don’t share the bonus program with their employees , and want us to only email specific people about it (they keep the $ for their leadership team). Every time before I send a bonus email, I get MAJOR anxiety about accidentally emailing the bonus to a loan broker shop employee that shouldn’t know about it (their employees are sales people selling our product). We have list filtering but I’m always worried one person slipped through (our sales team checks off who can get it in Salesforce, but they’ve made mistakes before). If the wrong person gets it, it could ruin a multi-million dollar relationship with a broker that does business with us. I always spot check but there are over 500 recipients. How can I manage my anxiety about this? Read more Share",

Hi, I am building a store that has the main Google search keywords for my niche in the URL e.g. buycarsonline dot com as an example. I have also registered a few other domains with keyword search terms (e.g. buycars dot online , buycars dot com and a few others but these are an example of my domains but not actually mine). My question is, can I use these other domains to drive traffic to my main domain if I were to build a site on them? Has anyone tried this before?

Perplexity 'Comet Plus' pays publishers for visits, citations, and agent actions. Available on its own, or included with Pro and Max subscriptions. Revenue is shared with websites, minus a small compute fee. SEJ STAFF Matt G. Southern 6 seconds ago ⋅ 2 min read SEJ STAFF Matt G. Southern Senior News Writer at Search Engine Journal Bio Follow { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Perplexity announced Comet Plus, a monthly subscription that pays participating publishers when people read their work and when AI systems use it to answer questions. The company says subscriber payments go to partners, with a small portion retained to cover compute costs. How Comet Plus Works Comet Plus will be available for $5 per month. Existing Perplexity Pro and Max subscribers will have Comet Plus included. Subscribers get direct access to participating publisher sites, answers informed by those sources, and agent workflows that can complete tasks on those sites. The offering is tied to the Comet browser and assistant. About Revenue Sharing Perplexity positions Comet Plus as a compensation model for an AI-centric web. Publishers are paid for three interaction types: Human visits Search citations Agent actions. Perplexity&rsquo;s example of &ldquo;agent traffic&rdquo; is Comet Assistant scanning a calendar and suggesting relevant reading from publisher sites. The idea is to reflect how people now consume information across browsing, AI answers, and agent workflows. Perplexity wrote: &ldquo;Comet Plus is the first compensation model... based on three types of internet traffic: human visits, search citations, and agent actions.&rdquo; Availability Interested publishers can email publishers@perplexity.ai to request to join the program. Why It Matters For publishers and marketers, the model expands monetization and measurement beyond traditional clicks. Websites are testing a range of responses to AI usage of their content, from blocking crawlers to signing licenses. Comet Plus differs from flat-fee deals by tying payouts to actual user and assistant activity, which could align compensation more closely with real demand. Looking Ahead Perplexity says it will announce an initial roster of publishing partners when the Comet browser becomes available to all users for free. Early adoption, reporting transparency, and real revenue for partners will determine whether this model becomes a viable framework or stays a niche experiment. Category News Generative AI",

    "essence": "ChatGPT Vs. Google At Every Stage Of The User Journey New Similarweb data shows the insane growth of ChatGPT and how different user behavior impacts downstream metrics. VIP CONTRIBUTOR Kevin Indig 22 seconds ago ⋅ 8 min read VIP CONTRIBUTOR Kevin Indig Growth Advisor Bio Follow { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Boost your skills with Growth Memo&rsquo;s weekly expert insights. Subscribe for free ! More data shows ChatGPT isn&rsquo;t taking market share away from Google. Instead, it&rsquo;s expanding the range of use cases and blurring the line between searching for information and performing tasks. I looked at Similarweb data to understand how this affects four different stages of the user journey across Google and ChatGPT: Usage. Behavior. Outbound clicks. Converting. What I found is that ChatGPT adoption is, essentially, a 400,000-pound locomotive barreling down the tracks with no intention of stopping anytime soon. User conversations within ChatGPT are rich in context, which leads to higher conversion rates when intent shifts from information seeking or generating to buying. Lastly, and also most notably for SEOs and growth marketers, ChatGPT is sending a lot more users out to the web. Of course, all of these stats are still small in comparison to Google. However, no effort from Google has been able to slow the momentum of ChatGPT&rsquo;s runaway train. About the data I used in this analysis: Data source: Similarweb (shoutout to Sam Sheridan). Time period examined: July 2024 – June 2025 (last 12 months) vs. July 2023 – June 2024 (previous 12 months). I also examined U.S. vs. UK user behavior. Image Credit Kevin Indig Visits: ChatGPT Is Growing At Rapid Pace People are rushing to ChatGPT. Over the last 12 months in the U.S., ChatGPT visits grew from 3.5 to 6.8 billion visits (+94%). In the UK, it was even faster: 131% YoY, from 868 million to 2 billion. Over the same time span, Google growth stagnated. Here&rsquo;s what the data showed: U.S. stagnation: -0.85% (196 vs. 194 billion). UK stagnation: -0.22% (35.56 vs. 35.49 billion). Image Credit: Kevin Indig To put it into perspective: Google had almost 200 billion visits in the U.S. over the last 12 months, compared to ChatGPT&rsquo;s 6.8 billion. So, ChatGPT has a mere 3.4% of Google&rsquo;s total visits. However, if growth rates hold steady, in theory, ChatGPT could hit Google&rsquo;s volume in the next five years. My hypothesis: It&rsquo;s almost guaranteed that ChatGPT won&rsquo;t hit Google&rsquo;s visit volume because there are too many moving parts (energy/chip limitations, training data, quality improvements, regulation, etc.). But consider that Google has declined by -0.85% (~2 billion visits) year-over-year, and you can see where this is going. Visits can only tell you so much. Recent data from Semrush and Profound suggests that one-third to two-thirds of user intent when interacting with AI chatbots is generative, meaning users use ChatGPT to do and less to search [ 1 , 2 ] . Leaked chats from ChatGPT and other AI chatbots confirm the aggregate data. So, even when we compare visits to ChatGPT vs. Google, they&rsquo;re not leading to the same outcome. But, against that argument, I will say that Google morphs more into a mirror of ChatGPT with AI Mode – and every generative intent has a high chance of including information along the conversation journey that is sourced to other sites or creators. The conversational nature of AI chatbots means intent is fluid and can change from one prompt to the next. Along the way, it&rsquo;s likely users come across information in their conversations that would&rsquo;ve been a classic Google Search for products or solutions. At the end of the day, ChatGPT is continuing its adoption as the fastest-growing product on earth to date. What does that mean for you? Stay the course. Keep tracking referral traffic, conversions, and topic visibility on Google + ChatGPT. Optimize for visibility with a strong focus on classic SEO. Keep an ear to the ground and learn as much as you can. Things are evolving fast, and clarity will come with time. Quick reminder here: I recently transitioned my WhatsApp group over to Slack. I share ongoing news and learnings throughout the week openly and freely, so it&rsquo;s a great place to stay updated without all the extra (and sometimes overwhelming) noise. No need to be a premium subscriber to get access to the main discussion channel. Join here ! On The Platform: User Behavior Context Is Rich Old habits are hard to break. People are used to searching on Google a certain way, while ChatGPT is a green field. For the overwhelming majority of us, our first experience with ChatGPT was a conversation, so we all adopted it as the default way to engage. Image Credit: Kevin Indig As a result, the average query prompt length on ChatGPT vs. Google is: 80 words vs 3.4 in the U.S. 91 words vs. 3.2 in the UK. Even informational prompts are 10 times longer (~38 words) on ChatGPT than on Google. People ask more detailed questions, which reveal much more about themselves and their intent. Together with a growing context window, ChatGPT returns much more personalized and (usually) better informational answers – I&rsquo;m still waiting on consistently better commercial/purchase intent outcomes. [ 3 ] AI chatbots compress the user journey from many queries over several days to one conversation with lengthy prompts. For you, this means it&rsquo;s even more critical to monitor the right prompts. (I shared a trick with premium subscribers for finding prompts in Google Search Console from AI Mode in Is AI cutting into your SEO conversions? ) Referral Traffic: Outgoing ChatGPT Traffic Grew By 723% In The US As referral traffic from Google reached historic lows, ChatGPT&rsquo;s referral traffic reached new highs. Image Credit: Kevin Indig Over the last 12 months, ChatGPT&rsquo;s U.S. referral traffic to websites jumped by +3,496% (UK: +5,950%), from 14 to 516 million (after cleaning up referrals to Openai.com, which are mostly authentications). In comparison, Google&rsquo;s outgoing referral visits grew only +23% in the U.S. and 19% in the UK. When you consider Google referrals include navigational searches (people navigating to the homepage of a brand) and ad clicks (ChatGPT doesn&rsquo;t yet have ads), 23% is not much at all. ChatGPT&rsquo;s referral traffic to external websites makes up ~27% of Google&rsquo;s (1.9 billion, in the last 12 months), based on the data. That feels high, in my field observation. Also consider that ChatGPT&rsquo;s goal is not necessarily to send out traffic but to keep the conversation going until users have the optimal response. That being said, referral traffic has grown and continues to do so. Until recently. According to Profound, ChatGPT&rsquo;s referral traffic was down -52% between July 21 and August 20. [ 4 ] And that&rsquo;s significant. Time will tell whether this is just an experiment or a final decision. For you, this means you should see more ChatGPT referral traffic over the last 12 months if you optimize well. You might not see an increase of +3,500%, but if you&rsquo;re not seeing at least some growth, it&rsquo;s likely your competitors are. Conversions: ChatGPT > Google Conversions from ChatGPT are small in comparison with Google (in volume), but they&rsquo;re growing rapidly. The whole narrative of investing in AI visibility optimization (AEO/GEO/LLMO) banks on the fact that it will continue at the same pace and become meaningful. So far, it seems like that bet will work out. Image Credit: Kevin Indig When ChatGPT sends traffic to sites, the conversion rate is usually higher than Google&rsquo;s. As of June 2025: ChatGPT&rsquo;s conversion rate of transactional traffic was 6.9% in the U.S. compared to 5.4% for Google. In the UK, ChatGPT reached 5.5%, which is on par with Google. ChatGPT sends higher-quality traffic to websites, at least in the U.S. I define quality in this context as &ldquo;higher intent,&rdquo; meaning visitors are more likely to convert into customers. The reason ChatGPT traffic is of higher quality is that users get answers to their questions in one conversation. When they click out, they&rsquo;re &ldquo;primed&rdquo; to buy. To me, the bigger question is how purchase decisions are influenced before a click happens (or even when no click-out happens). For you, this means: Look at which pages get referral traffic. Take the average referral traffic and optimize pages that get some but below-average clicks. Optimizing for citations matters because citations are what get clicked. Look at the citation gap between your competitors and your site. Look for conversion optimization opportunities (in-line CTAs, lead gen assets, quizzes, etc) on pages that get ChatGPT referral traffic. Using a standard heatmap tool will point you to areas of the page that are ideal for a little CRO. Bringing It All Together ChatGPT has all the ingredients to become the next big user platform on which other companies can build – just like Google 25 years ago: Usage is growing. Behavior is rich in context. Referral traffic is shooting up. Conversions happen at a healthy rate. Now, traffic and conversations just need more volume. They&rsquo;re still tiny in comparison.

What would you do to beat the industry leader? Question I am a bit upset with this whole marketing world... Maybe I am just jealous... Case studies are often rigged - in terms of big corps have the power to \"push through\" SEO, Google Ads easily, and can test everything with their \"endless\" money. For, little brands, they have to hack everything and figure out what works on a lower scale... E.g. if you want to launch a Pmax campaign, but in a very, very niche IT security B2B enterprise market, and the competitor has 100x more resources, and they do not need leads from Google Ads they are just there to brand themselves - but because of this, the price is so high that you can not test anything… Free market my ass :D Sorry for venting this.

Learn what decades of search history can teach us about adapting to the next big shift. Historic recurrence is the idea that patterns repeat over time, even if the details differ. In digital marketing , change is the only constant. Over the last 30 years, we&rsquo;ve seen nonstop shifts and transformations in platforms and tactics. Search, social, and mobile have each gone through their own waves of evolution.  But AI represents something bigger &ndash; not just another tactic, but a fundamental shift in how people research, evaluate, and buy products and services. Estimates vary, but Gartner projects that AI-driven search could account for 25% of search volume by the end of 2026. I suspect the true share will be much higher as Google weaves AI deeper into its results. For digital marketers, it can feel like we need a crystal ball to predict what&rsquo;s next.  While we don&rsquo;t have magical foresight, we do have the next best thing: lessons from the past. This article looks back at the early days of search, how user behavior evolved alongside technology, and what those patterns can teach us as we navigate the AI era. The early days: Wild and wonderful queries If you remember the early web &ndash; AltaVista, Lycos, Yahoo, Hotbot &ndash; search was a free-for-all.  People typed in long, rambling queries, sometimes entire sentences, other times just a few random words that &ldquo;felt&rdquo; right. There were no search suggestions, no &ldquo;people also ask,&rdquo; and no autocorrect.  It was a simpler time, often summed up as &ldquo;10 blue links.&rdquo; Searchers had to experiment, refine, and iterate on their own, and the variance in query wording was huge. For marketers, that meant opportunity",

Recent research highlights intriguing paradoxes in consumer attitudes toward AI-driven marketing. Consumers encounter AI-powered marketing interactions frequently, often without realizing it. According to a 2022 Pew Research Center survey, 27% of Americans reported interacting with AI at least several times a day, while another 28% said they interact with AI about once a day or several times a week (Pew Research Center, 2023). As AI adoption continues to expand across industries, marketing applications &ndash; from personalized recommendations to chatbots &ndash; are increasingly shaping consumer experiences. According to McKinsey & Company (2023), AI-powered personalization can deliver five to eight times the ROI on marketing spend and significantly boost customer engagement. In this rapidly evolving landscape, trust in AI has become a crucial factor for successful adoption and long-term engagement. The World Economic Forum under&shy;scores that &ldquo;trust is the foundation for AI&rsquo;s widespread acceptance,&rdquo; and emphasizes the necessity for companies to adopt self-governance frameworks that prioritize transparency, accountability, and fairness (World Economic Forum, 2025). The Psychology Of AI Trust Consumer trust in AI marketing systems operates fundamentally differently from traditional marketing trust mechanisms.

News Perplexity is rolling out a game-changing move for the AI era: it’s offering publishers a cut of the revenue from AI-powered searches via its new Comet Plus subscription service. They've earmarked a $42.5 million pool, and publishers get a whopping 80% of revenues , while Perplexity retains just 20%. Why it matters: This is one of the first real attempts at fair AI–publisher cooperation—paying not just for licensing, but based on actual usage of their content in AI responses. It’s a direct counter to the “Google Zero” problem, where AI summaries steal traffic and value without compensating creators. Plus, it comes amid mounting legal pressure—Perplexity just lost a court bid in a News Corp lawsuit, pushing them toward solutions like this. This could be a turning point for how AI services and journalism coexist. Thoughts on whether this model is sustainable or if it will spark broader industry shifts? Read more Share",

    "essence": "Search Engine Land » PPC » Article How to tell if Google Ads automation helps or hurts your campaigns Published: August 26, 2025 at 8:00 am Read Time: 8 minutes Share Written by Ameet Khabra Table of Contents Table of Contents Google Ads automation is powerful, but not foolproof. Learn the signs it’s on track – and the signals it’s steering performance wrong. Smart Bidding ,  Performance Max , and  responsive search ads  (RSAs) can all deliver efficiency, but only if they&rsquo;re optimizing for the right signals. The issue isn&rsquo;t that automation makes mistakes. It&rsquo;s that those mistakes compound over time. Left unchecked, that drift can quietly inflate your CPAs, waste spend, or flood your pipeline with junk leads. Automation isn&rsquo;t the enemy, though. The real challenge is knowing when it&rsquo;s helping and when it&rsquo;s hurting your campaigns. Here&rsquo;s how to tell. When automation is actually failing These are cases where automation isn&rsquo;t just constrained by your inputs. It&rsquo;s actively pushing performance in the wrong direction. Performance Max cannibalization The issue PMax often prioritizes cheap, easy traffic &ndash; especially branded queries or high-intent searches you intended to capture with Search campaigns.  Even with brand exclusions, Google still serves impressions against brand queries, inflating reported performance and giving the illusion of efficiency.  On top of that, when PMax and Search campaigns overlap, Google&rsquo;s auction rules give PMax priority, meaning carefully built Search campaigns can lose impressions they should own. A clear sign this is happening: if you see Search Lost IS (rank) rising in your Search campaigns while PMax spend increases, it&rsquo;s likely PMax is siphoning traffic. Recommendation Use brand exclusions and negatives in PMax to block queries you want Search to own.  Segment brand and non-brand campaigns so you can track each cleanly. And to monitor branded traffic specifically, tools ",

I have also registered a few other domains with keyword search terms (e.g. buycars.online , buycars.com and a few othersv as an example).

Download the Free Templates Updated: 08/26/25 A few years ago, I was in charge of presenting a big marketing strategy deck to a senior executive. My team and I prepared a script that went something like this: “In Q3, we’ll deliver a unified editorial calendar. Subject matter will reinforce key audience pain points. We will increase paid media investments to leverage this series in integrated campaigns.” It sounded so impressive in my head, but the executive just wanted clarity. She asked, “So, what is it exactly? A blog series we promote in paid?” Oops. In that moment, I realized the words I was using were all wrong. I wasn’t just doing this in meetings. I was adopting this voice in all the brand’s content I was creating, too. I call that jargon-filled approach “content voice.” And since that meeting, I’ve been on a mission to stop its spread — both in my work and at other brands. Let’s break down exactly what content voice means and how to avoid it, along with some real examples of brands that get it right. Table of Contents What is content voice?

Retail media networks are projected to be worth $179.5 billion by 2025 , but capturing share and achieving long-term success won&rsquo;t hinge solely on growing their customer base. With over 200 retail media networks now competing for advertiser attention, the landscape has become increasingly complex and crowded. The RMNs that stand out will be those taking a differentiated approach to meeting the evolving needs of advertisers. The industry&rsquo;s concentration creates interesting dynamics. While some platforms have achieved significant scale, nearly 70% of RMN buyers cite &ldquo;complexity in the buying process&rdquo; as their biggest obstacle. That tension, between explosive growth and operational complexity, is forcing the industry to evolve beyond traditional approaches. As the landscape matures, which strategies will define the next wave of growth: global expansion, hyperlocal targeting, or both? The evolution of retail media platforms To understand where the industry is heading, it&rsquo;s worth examining how successful platforms are addressing advertisers&rsquo; core challenges. Lack of measurement standards across platforms continues to frustrate advertisers who want to compare performance across networks. Manual processes dominate smaller networks , making campaign management inefficient and time-consuming. At the same time, most retailers lack the digital footprint necessary for standalone success. This has created opportunities for platforms that can solve multiple problems simultaneously: standardization, automation, and scale. DoorDash represents an interesting case study in this evolution.

Members Online • SocialNoel Stumbled Upon HealthGEO Just checked out Real Chemistry’s new HealthGEO tool and wow, as someone working in healthcare marketing, this feels like the future. Here’s the gist: HealthGEO uses healthcare-optimized AI to show how platforms like ChatGPT and Gemini really describe your brand, therapies, and science—warts and all. It goes way beyond regular SEO. With HealthGEO, you get: A dashboard mapping your company’s digital reputation across leading AI models Early alerts for weird hallucinations, outdated info, or negative tone Direct benchmarks versus competitors in your space Actionable advice to fix gaps, improve messaging, and build trust Why does this matter? Patients and HCPs now search using AI, not just Google, and that can lead to major misinformation risks. HealthGEO is built to help brands spot issues fast and keep their communication transparent and accurate. In my view, this is essential tech if you want to build a patient-first brand as digital search evolves. Anyone else excited to try this kind of tool, or already doing AI reputation checks for healthcare brands? Would love to swap ideas! Read more Share",

A few months old website so metrics are a bit rough but improving. We have quality blogs in the pipe, so that will hopefully increase the metrics on its own with time but we are now trying to buy some Fiverr gigs to help increase this for us. As I've understood it if we do too much backlink work in too short of a timespan google sees it as a red flag. What does this mean exactly, and where is the limit? How much is too much. And what work would you do if you were us. Some are offering guest posts on sites with DR 20-50, some are offering 100-400 white hat links for instance. Can we do both? How many guest posts can we do, what is too much? How many white hat links (whatever that means) can we do without geting penalized. We want to do as much as possible in as little time as possible. Below is our current stats according to moz: Moz Domain Authority 5 Moz Page Authority 19 Semrush Authority Score 9 Total Backlinks 31 Quality Backlinks 5 % Quality Backlinks 16% DoFollow Backlinks 20% NoFollow Backlinks 80%",

Comet AI Browser Vulnerability Brave described a vulnerability that can be activated when a user asks the Comet AI browser to summarize a web page. The LLM will read the web page, including any embedded prompts that command the LLM to take action on any open tabs According to Brave: &ldquo;The vulnerability we&rsquo;re discussing in this post lies in how Comet processes webpage content: when users ask it to &ldquo;Summarize this webpage,&rdquo; Comet feeds a part of the webpage directly to its LLM without distinguishing between the user&rsquo;s instructions and untrusted content from the webpage. This allows attackers to embed indirect prompt injection payloads that the AI will execute as commands. For instance, an attacker could gain access to a user&rsquo;s emails from a prepared piece of text in a page in another tab.&rdquo; A post on Simon Willison&rsquo;s Weblog shared that Perplexity tried to patch the vulnerability but the fix does not work. A developer posted the following on X: &ldquo;Why is no one talking about this? This is why I don&rsquo;t use an AI browser You can literally get prompt injected and your bank account drained by doomscrolling on reddit:&rdquo; Things aren&rsquo;t looking good for Comet Browser at this time.

Taking a step further to resolve day to day and timely performance degradation of our campaigns, last month we introduced a heavy infusion of AI based creation/analysis and optimization into our performance marketing campaigns for different different key aspects of our campaigns Frequent problem statements that we heard from our clients in the past 1.) Sudden downfall of performance campaigns after a great start 2.) Very high CPC's for google search 3.) High competition and lower ad spends for our clients 4.) Very high CPM's on FB ads 5.) Non consistent daily/weekly performance 6.) Lower ROI's From an Industry point of view - forecasting(predictive analysis) communication customization(more like a personalized or need based) testing(a/b testing of key communications and landing pages) behaviour analysis(more from a audience personna deep dive for targeting) and new content creation (for AMS & Website) From media buying point of view 1.)

Support I’ll keep it very short: I’ve got a really nice digital product. Everyone who tested it loves it. MVP is running and the whole technical side is complete. Now the marketing starts. For me this is the hardest part as I’m a maker, not a marketeer. I’ve got €600 left. So I thought Facebook ads. But my target demographic is 200.000.000 according to Facebook. So with €600 I won’t get far. It’s probably not enough for Facebook to get the algorithm running and see which people are most likely to buy my product. I tried contacting influencers. But they also all want money up front. (Just being a 40% affiliate is not enough for them). And paying €150 for 2 stories on a micro influencer page seems ridiculous to me. I’m willing to give part of the company to an investor, but only like 20%-30% max. But getting investors online is also very expensive. Those dedicated websites all cost like €2k a month. Does anyone of you have an idea to continue? Edit: it’s B2C and it’s in the pet industry (Dogs) Read more Share",

Others draw goatees on their chins to mimic his distinct look. Spotify honors these and other rituals of diehard fans in the latest chapter of its “Fan Life” campaign, which debuted in April . For this installment, the streamer is expanding upon the vivid photography of the original ads with films that dive into the real-life fandoms of Pitbull, Bad Bunny, Charli XCX, Lil Uzi Vert, Rezz, Sleep Token, and Megan Moroney. Every fan has different ways of showing their dedication. The Pitbull ad, for example, shows a group of concertgoers on a bus, carefully putting the finishing touches on their matching uniforms. In another spot, a young Bad Bunny fan delicately twirls his abuela as they dance together in a crowded kitchen, as others look on and applaud.  Meanwhile, a couple of Charli XCX devotees ride a bike through a neighborhood after an extremely late night out. They’re laughing hysterically, with one holding a handful of pink balloons.   The ads, created by Spotify&#8217;s in-house team, will appear on social, billboards, and subway stations in the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Colombia. Other spots depict crowds wearing Rezz’s trademark HypnoGoggles; young women belting out lyrics to Megan Maroney&#8217;s &#8220;Tennessee Orange;&#8221; and Young Sleep Token fans spray-painting lawn flamingos black in honor of the mysterious English metal band.  “Fan Life” will also spotlight the fans of local artists revered by regional audiences, including Aitana (Spain), La Mano 1.9 (France), Nina Chuba (Germany), Sabino (Mexico), Pabllo Vittar (Brazil), and PinkPantheress (",

Will Cain 8 Months After His Show Launch  'I have a vision of what I want the show to be, and I think we're continuing to evolve it into that vision,' Cain said.   Will Cain in the studio of his 4 p.m. ET show Courtesy of Fox News By Mark Mwachiro --> Will Cain may still be the new kid on the block when it comes to his show’s inclusion in the Fox News weekday schedule, but his show’s performance since its January launch has him feeling like a veteran. The Will Cain Show has averaged 2.3 million viewers and 275,000 in the Adults 25-54 demo since it debuted on Jan. 21. The 4 p.m. ET show has also grown the timeslot with a +42% jump in total viewers and +53% rise in the demo compared to the same hour in 2024. When TVNewser first caught up with Cain in January , he approached building the show from a vantage of “being open-minded, honest about your opinion, hearing rebuttal, weighing the facts, and seeking the truth.” Now, hosting from the confines of his recently unveiled studio in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex , a nearly settled Cain has sought to establish his show as one that focuses “on stories that are not getting enough attention in the news and not doing the same stories that have been done by other programs all throughout the day.” Cain was gracious enough to sit through another edition of TVNewser’s “5 Questions For…” series as we checked in to see how things are moving along in the 4 p.m. ET hour since the show’s January debut. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Eight months in. How&#8217;s it going on the Will Cain show? It&#8217;s going really well. I think there are two different ways to judge a show. One is the outward metrics, ratings, and definitions of success that include the opinions of the people who matter inside your organization, and that&#8217;s been an overwhelming and great success. I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased with being the highest-rated show in daytime on Fox and blowing away the comp",

Aflac By Jason Notte --> The Women’s National Basketball Players Association opted out of the WNBA&#8217;s current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) last October, seeking greater salary incentives and benefits, especially as league viewership and attendance continue to grow.  Now, with the CBA set to expire on Oct. 31, a potential work stoppage is on the horizon for 2026 if an agreement isn’t reached. As the WNBA postseason approaches and the CBA deadline looms, players believe they have a right to a greater share of league revenue from sources including sponsorships. With no animosity toward the league, brands and their observers tend to agree—as do the numbers. The data doesn’t lie Wasserman’s women-focused practice, The Collective, released a report in 2023 that noted that athletes in men’s sports earn 21 times more salary than women playing those same sports. As a result, women in sports rely on brands and sponsorship for 82% of their income (compared to just 37% for men) while their salary comprises just 18% of their total compensation (67% for men). “The reason that they’re prolific on social media is because they have to be … that’s where they build their audiences. That’s where they build their brand. That’s where they get their money. So as a result, they’re good at it,” Elizabeth Lindsey, Wasserman’s global president of brands and properties, said during a panel in Nike Global Headquarters in Oregon in July.

Members Online • Ketul-Sindhwad Yesterday we discussed AI Agents — here’s what I’ve learned (and the next big question) Discussion Yesterday I posted about AI Agents as the “employees” of the future, and the responses were amazing. Some of you shared how you’re already testing agents in marketing, automation, and even customer support. Others raised valid concerns about reliability, cost, and control. After going through the comments, I realized one key takeaway: ➡️ The real power of AI Agents isn’t just in replacing one task, but in orchestrating multiple tasks together like a mini digital workforce. That got me thinking about the next step: Instead of single-task agents, what happens when we have multi-agent systems working together? Could we see companies running like “digital organizations” where agents act as a content team, marketing team, and ops team — all coordinating automatically? And if that happens… what roles do humans play? Strategy only? Creativity? Oversight? I’d love to keep the discussion going: 👉 Do you think multi-agent collaboration is realistic in the next 2–3 years, or is this still a long-term dream? 👉 What real-world barriers do you see (tech limits, trust, legal issues, etc.)? Looking forward to your thoughts — yesterday’s thread was 🔥 and I’m excited to dive deeper with all of you. Read more Share",

Members Online • Key-Hyena5292 Why don’t we actually use Indian apps when we preach #MadeInIndia? Discussion I’ve noticed something that honestly bugs me. We love to say #MadeInIndia until it comes to actually using Indian apps. The moment an Indian alternative launches, there’s either silence or instant skepticism. Meanwhile, people abroad back their homegrown products effortlessly and with pride. That’s what pushed us to build something new: Vokal India. It’s Aadhaar-verified, secure, and built for Indians. No shady logins, no random data leaks just a platform that puts trust first. We didn’t make this because it was trendy. We made it because we were done waiting for someone else to solve it. Right now, we’re testing it out with a small circle and looking for genuine feedback. So here’s my ask what do you think stops us from supporting Indian tech the way others support theirs? Is it trust? UX? Just habit? I’d love to hear honest takes. Read more Share",

Members Online • Alozaps Major Movement on Bing Help Is anyone seeing a big change with rankings and traffic on Bing in the last 24-48 hours? For me, traffic appears to have completely collapsed. There are no penalties or guidelines issues in Webmaster Tools. A lot of previously high-performing pages (ranking in the top 3) look to have fallen out of the SERPs entirely. Pages can show up if you do a site search, but they're not ranking at all. I'm seeing a lot of random, low-quality SEO sites dominate the top results now. I have always killed it with Bing, ranking at the top of their SERPs for years. I hope this is just a temporary blip and things will go back to normal later. Read more Share",

    "essence": "Search Engine Land » PPC » Article Google Ads expands PMax Channel Reporting to account level Published: August 25, 2025 at 4:42 pm Read Time: 1 minute Share Written by Anu Adegbola Table of Contents Table of Contents Advertisers can now spot cross-campaign trends and performance patterns in PMax with a single account-level view. Performance Max (PMax) advertisers just got a major visibility upgrade: Channel Reporting is now available at the account level, not just within individual campaigns. How it works: View and compare all PMax campaigns in a single reporting overview. Segment by conversion metrics to understand what&rsquo;s driving results. Identify performance patterns across channels without jumping campaign to campaign. Why we care. Until now, channel performance data was siloed within each PMax campaign. The new account-level reporting makes it easier to spot trends, compare results, and optimize across campaigns. The big picture. Google notes that channel data is available for PMax campaigns &ldquo;at this time&rdquo; &mdash; a phrasing that suggests the feature could expand to other campaign types down the road. Bottom line. More visibility, less friction. This change gives advertisers a faster, more complete view of PMax performance &mdash; and hints at broader reporting upgrades ahead. First seen.

Members Online • Puzzleheaded_Size447 Lead Magnet Vs. Direct to Booking - Which makes more sense? To give some context I am a franchise broker (think a realtor but for franchise businesses), my broad target demo are people who want to buy a franchise and are currently in the 'investigative stage' where they are ready to make a move in the next 1-3 months if they found 'the right' model. I'm advertising on Meta ($6k/mo ad spend) with a small agency (this guys is definitely good and knows what he is doing in terms of getting on-paper qualified leads through the campaign). Our current ad method is to pick one of the high performing franchises we have, advertise it like the actual brand would, but we don't disclose the name (because if we did they could just go directly to the brand and I would never know/wouldn't get paid). So they have to come to me, and on our call we go through what they're looking for, if the industry is even a fit for them, and then I can schedule a follow up call to go through multiple options that fit as good if not better for what they're looking for. With that said, I am at a little bit of a crossroad with how the marketing is going. As I've talked with these leads, they tend to be very hesitant coming onto the call since they don't know what franchise we're referencing, and then when they get on they're primarily looking for info on the specific franchise we were advertising for. **Now I'm not ignorant to how actual sales works, and know that you need to be asking good, deeper level motivation questions to be able to sell effectively. This is a skillset I'm actively developing** With this said, I'm big into Alex Hormozi's content and am reading his $100M Leads again, and am hung up on his idea of 'lead magnet' to either uncover a problem they didn't know they had, or solves one step in a multistep process to encourage them to then book a call after providing a good amount of value. This is especially true for high ticket items like what I do. With our current ad method, we are doing the 'direct offer/book call' instead of providing any value up front to build trust and rapport with the lead before they book the call. I really see where Alex is coming from to get higher quality engaged leads with his 'value/lead magnet' first, then show them how its hard, then finally offer them to book a call. With the current lead production, it seems like I'll just have to become a dog of a sales person (not with 'tricks' but with actual skill) which I can imagine is going to take years of reps to harness. I guess my question comes down to this- Do I just take on that task of becoming this elite level sales guy and figure it out? Or try to build a more 'Hormozi' style ad campaign where peop",

Help I maintain a travel booking website that is a few years old and doesn't have much SEO juice right now (though it does have some). My client wants to give it a big SEO push, and is asking me for a plan and budget to start creating new content for the site. The problem: the client tried to register the current domain for the website as a trademark, and it got denied by my country's trademark office for being too generic. We came up with a new name and submitted it, and we think it has reasonable chances of being approved, but it will take the trademark office at least 3-6 months (counting from now), or perhaps even more. My idea has always been that, as soon as the trademark office approves the new name, I'll clone the current website in the new domain and add redirects in the existing domain, but I don't know whether it's worth it to start creating content now in the existing website in the old domain, when we'll have to migrate anyway in a few months. However, my client is in a rush and wants me to start ASAP. What would be maximum \"waiting period\" when it's still worth it to start working on the current site now? What I mean is: if I knew that we could start using the new domain in a month, obviously I would wait, and if I knew for sure that the trademark office was going to take another year (!), then I'd start working now in the current domain.

I have a portfolio site (for my web development journey), so I could add a blog. Or something else? I recently saw a position that asked for a commercial real estate writing sample as part of the application, so curious if ranking something like that would wow agency owners more. Read more Share",

Used to get indexed within 5-10 minutes, sometimes even faster, but now it’s taking over 3 hours or more. I checked Google Search Console, and there doesn’t seem to be any major issues flagged. I also heard there have been some recent updates or changes in the Google Search Console API or indexing process, but I’m not sure how that might affect indexing times. Has anyone experienced similar delays lately? Any ideas or solutions on how to speed up the indexing? Could it be related to API updates, or is there something I’m missing? Thanks in advance!

Members Online • Ketul-Sindhwad What exactly are AI Agents and how are they shaping the future of business & marketing? Discussion Hey everyone, Lately, I’ve been diving deep into the concept of AI Agents and I feel like this space is going to explode in the next few years. From what I understand, AI Agents are basically autonomous programs powered by AI models (like GPTs) that can reason, plan, and take actions on their own to achieve a specific goal. Unlike a regular chatbot that just answers queries, these agents can: • Gather data from different sources • Make decisions based on logic + past inputs • Trigger actions like sending emails, scraping data, or updating CRMs • Even collaborate with other AI agents for complex workflows In marketing & business automation, I’m already seeing use cases like: • Automating SEO tasks (keyword research, content briefs, backlink outreach) • Running personalized ad campaigns with zero human touch • Handling customer support with multi-step reasoning • Managing sales pipelines end-to-end It feels like we’re moving from “AI as an assistant” → to “AI as an employee.” 🔹 Do you think AI Agents will replace traditional SaaS tools in the near future? 🔹 Anyone here experimenting with them in real projects (marketing, e-commerce, ops)? 🔹 Which frameworks/platforms are you using (Auto-GPT, CrewAI, LangChain, etc.)? Would love to hear your thoughts and real-world experiences. Read more Share",

In 2025, people aren&rsquo;t just searching for answers anymore. They&rsquo;re looking for genuine responses from the people they trust most:  Creators. Communities. Fellow brand supporters.  In many ways, community has become an algorithm of its own. AI-powered tools like Google Gemini , ChatGPT , and Perplexity have made knowledge more accessible than ever.  But in doing so, they&rsquo;ve also flattened it.  Answers feel repetitive, citations pull from the same limited sources, and brand voices risk becoming interchangeable. That&rsquo;s where community comes in.  While generative AI commoditizes information, community restores individuality.  It offers what no model can compress into tokens:  Authentic connection. Lived experience. Trust. When democratized information becomes homogenized I can still remember when Google &ndash; and later YouTube &ndash; made information feel democratized, putting knowledge at our fingertips like never before. But with the rise of AI, that same accessibility now comes at a cost: everything starts to sound the same. Every brand competing for similar keywords risks becoming interchangeable, sounding the same in AI-generated summaries that deliver information without distinction.  Meanwhile, authority is concentrated into a small set of repeatedly cited sources, so users encounter little variation in what LLMs surface. In some ways, this is similar to traditional SEO .  But there&rsquo;s an important difference: websites once gave us the chance to &ldquo;get our brand over&rdquo; and show what made our solution unique.  That&rsquo;s what feels lost in an AI-driven search ",

In the lawsuit, she alleged that KMOV triggered anxiety and depression and harmed her job prospects and that Danahey was demoted through schedule changes under a new news director hired in 2016. Danahey worked at KMOV for about six years starting in 2014 until being fired in 2020. She originally sued both the station’s news director Scott Diener as well as KMOV’s then-parent company, Meredith Corporation. The suit was later split in two. She lost the case against Diener when the jury ruled unanimously for Diener in April.

While those elements are important, they&rsquo;re meaningless unless they sit on a foundation of alignment with client needs. The cleanest account structure and flawless creatives may hit every platform benchmark, but any success will be short-lived if you&rsquo;re not clued into what&rsquo;s actually important to your clients. Higher revenues, more profit, better lead quality, shorter sales cycles &ndash; this is what typically matters to the people paying the bills. At JXT Group, we make sure that the foundation is laid before building a single campaign by gathering a clear picture of how our clients make money, who their ideal customers are, and what a proper conversion looks like. Here are the five phases we use to engineer that experience. 1. Understand The Business Model Financially, most Google Ads clients can be split into one of two business models: those that sell products at face value and those that want leads who convert at a later date, typically through an offline interaction. Verticals like ecommerce and info products sell their goods (physical or otherwise) at face value, allowing you to see revenue figures inside of Google Ads. Verticals like local services and SaaS rely on capturing interest in the form of phone calls, form fills, and chat sessions. These leads may or may not turn into actual sales later. Anyone dealing with physical products also has to factor cash flow, procurement costs, shipping fees, and return rates into bo",

    "essence": "Data & Insights Marketing and Advertising Internships Are on the Decline The downward trend parallels a decrease in young people employed in the industry overall The reason isn't always a lack of opportunity. deagreez/Adobe Stock By Paul Hiebert --> Many careers in marketing and advertising begin with an internship. At a time when the share of young people working in the industry is decreasing , it should come as no surprise that internships are also disappearing. Figures from employment data provider Live Data Technologies show a year-over-year decline in internships at U.S. marketing and advertising companies since 2022. In addition to the overall decline, the seasonal spike in internships during the summer has also become less pronounced in recent years. In 2022, the number of interns in June was nearly 125% higher than those in January of that same year. This year, however, marketing and advertising internships in June were up only 40% compared to the beginning of 2025. To arrive at these findings, Live Data Technologies examined publicly available information from several U.S. marketing and advertising companies. The list includes ad giants IPG and Omnicom, along with Publicis agencies Digitas and Starcom. Internships at marketing and advertising agencies appear to be dropping for a few reasons. One is companies’ increasing push to diminish labor costs through layoffs , consolidation , and artificial intelligence . Because of that, companies are less likely to invest in early-career employees, according to analysts. “The continued infusion of AI and automation has led to a decline in entry-level roles for many organizations, with hiring priority shifting to mid- and senior-level positions,” said Justin Roberts, associate vice president of global culture and inclusion at independent media agency Kepler. Additional numbers from Live Data Technologies illustrate this shift. Staff positions at U.S. marketing and advertising firms have diminished nearly 11% since January 2022. Manager and director jobs, meanwhile, have remained relatively steady during the same period. “The entry-level crunch has a trickle-down effect,” said J. Scott Hamilton, president and CEO of Live Data Technologies. “With no junior roles to fill next year, there will be fewer internships this year.” In addition to a decline in available roles, there’s less demand for the types of internships many agencies offer—particularly unpaid ones. Laura Emanuel, managing director at Red Thread PR, said applicants used to clamor for the agency’s unpaid internship. She remembers working with a group of three or four interns each season. Deciding who to pick from a pool of candidates was difficult. “Ten years ago, we would promote our internships with a single social post and be inundated with eager, ambitious college students pitching themselves for the role,” Emanuel said. “It was a truly competitive search.” That’s no longer the case. Now, the public relations agency looks to bring in ",

Question I’m currently on my second product launch, and my first attempt at marketing didn’t go the way I hoped. It wasn’t a total failure, but it taught me some lessons I’m applying this time around. From my first launch, I learned that running ads before validating the product is a mistake. It’s tempting to think ads will solve traction, but without product-market fit, they just burn cash. The second lesson was that relying only on word-of-mouth isn’t enough. Early users talked, but growth stalled fast. Now, I’m balancing organic channels with small, targeted experiments instead of going all-in on one approach. I’d love to hear from others , what’s been your biggest marketing mistake, and how do you approach marketing effectively without overspending or overcomplicating? Read more Share",

VIP CONTRIBUTOR Alexander Kesler August 25, 2025 &#8901; 11 min read VIP CONTRIBUTOR Alexander Kesler Founder & CEO at INFUSE Bio Follow 649 READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> In a post &ldquo;growth-at-all-costs&rdquo; era, B2B go-to-market (GTM) teams face a dual mandate: operate with greater efficiency while driving measurable business outcomes . Many organizations see AI as the definitive means of achieving this efficiency. The reality is that AI is no longer a speculative investment. It has emerged as a strategic enabler to unify data, align siloed teams, and adapt to complex buyer behaviors in real time. According to an SAP study, 48% of executives use generative AI tools daily, while 15% use AI multiple times per day. The opportunity for modern Go-to-Market (GTM) leaders is not just to accelerate legacy tactics with AI, but to reimagine the architecture of their GTM strategy altogether. This shift represents an inflection point. AI has the potential to power seamless and adaptive GTM systems: measurable, scalable, and deeply aligned with buyer needs. In this article, I will share a practical framework to modernize B2B GTM using AI, from aligning internal teams and architecting modular workflows to measuring what truly drives revenue. The Role Of AI In Modern GTM Strategies For GTM leaders and practitioners, AI represents an opportunity to achieve efficiency without compromising performance. Many organizations leverage new technology to automate repetitive, time-intensive tasks, such as prospect scoring and routing, sales forecasting, content personalization, and account prioritization. But its true impact lies in transforming how GTM systems operate: consolidating data, coordinating actions, extracting insights, a",

ESPN BET By Jason Notte --> ESPN is making significant changes ahead of the 2025 college and NFL football seasons, and its new campaign from ESPN Bet Sportsbook is guiding fans through the tunnel, connecting games, gaming, and content. Today, ESPN Bet is launching its “Sportsbook for Sports Fans” marketing push, with new ads showing fans navigating data and bets from the couch, changing up their fantasy football roster at the bar, and making parlay bets in a laundromat with picks from ESPN personalities—including ad narrator and ESPN First Take host and executive producer Stephen A. Smith. Developed with help from creative agency Prophet, the spots showcase the sportsbook’s recently introduced FanCenter, which personalizes offerings based on wagering history, ESPN app favorites, and players on their fantasy rosters. The ads also highlight updating player stat cards and game logs, as well as featured bets from Smith and First Take, host Mike Greenberg and his Get Up show, ESPN Bet Live, and other programming. In a nod to one of ESPN’s biggest recent moves, the campaigns show bet-tracking features that allow fans to follow their bets on screen while watching games on the recently launched ESPN streaming app. As ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro told The Athletic during the app’s launch earlier this week, “it is the first inning” of the company’s digital and streaming innovations and integrations. Disney Reveals Marketing Game Plan for Its ESPN Streaming App “There are millions of people who use ESPN to get their stats, their stories about their favorite players, and the biggest fantasy sports product in the world,” said Gadi Rouache, head of design and creative at PENN Interactive. “What we’re creating is a seamless experience to connect sports fans to sports betting in a way that is intuitive and at your fingertips.” In the first ad, “Tools,” ESPN Bet argues that it’s streamlining the game day experience by showing a fan doing fantasy football research in front of multiple monitors before eventually grabbing a smartphone and using the sportsbook to browse stats. In the same ad, another fan watching an ESPN studio show opens the sportsbook app to find bets related to what’s being discussed on screen. The second, “Game Time,” features a fan using ESPN’s DTC service to browse live betting markets, place a bet on ESPN Bet, and track the wager from her couch. The scene then cuts to two fans at a bar pulling up FanCenter and doubling down on their fantasy football matchup with an additional bet. “When we first floated the idea of the laundromat, we had some colleagues that looked at us quizzically, but we were saying that, for sports fans—and that is ",

Members Online • philbilly86 Unsure of what to do in my current in-house position (SEO/Search related). Question I work in-house as an SEO/Content manager selling used cars and automotive accessories. My team publishes regular blog content around car buying, ownership, financing, modification, customisation and maintenance. We’ve built structured content clusters, and most of the work follows a conservative, factual approach. The problem is that our visibility in Google seems stuck. Impressions often climb but clicks trend down. Content ranks initially, then either flattens or drops. When we refresh and optimise, results stay static or fall further. Case and point - our traffic is down 10% WoW, and keywords that have lost the most traffic are branded keywords (products we don't sell). Other keywords that have lost clicks have grown in impressions, maintained rankings but had the ass fall out of them in terms of clicks. Now my teams wants to go back and 'optimise' content they worked on less that 3 weeks ago. Our team is very much aware of the role that social search and video search plays in populating the search, but I'm struggling to figure out what I can do to help our existing content rank higher, given what I can control and influence. Off-site content and backlinks sit outside my control. I’d like to create stronger assets like comparison tables, visuals, or videos, but I don’t have extra resources. Development support is another bottleneck. I'm trying hard to work on tracking secondary metrics such as product page views from SEO content, but marketing intelligence resources aren't there for now. Right now 99.9% of traffic comes from Google search. Less than 0.005% came from LLMs or AI tools last month. At this stage I don’t see how I can meaningfully optimise for LLMs without bigger resources, and I suspect strong SEO practices already align well with AI discovery. So here’s where I’m stuck: How do I break out of this flatline without more budget for advanced content formats? Are there approaches you’ve seen succeed when you can’t influence backlinks? Any ideas on making existing clusters perform better instead of just producing more? With tracking blocked by limited dev capacity, how do you make a business case for more investment? Really struggling here and would appreciate any input from people that have navigated these seas in the past. Read more Share",

Question Having been working with marketing automation for many years, I’m not questioning its importance; we all see how central it has become. What I’m curious about is the value of being certified in it. If someone offered you a chance to get certified in marketing automation, what would make you not want to do it? Do you feel like the industry doesn’t really value certifications? Is it more about cost and time than content? Or do you prefer just learning hands-on with the tools you already use? I’m asking because I’m working on something in this space and don’t want to assume. I want to understand the real objections, hesitations, or “meh, not for me” reasons. Would love to hear your honest take. And if you’ve done any automation certs before, what actually made it worthwhile for you? (Or not?) Read more Share",

I love to focus on organic reach and making sure posts actually perform. On average the campaigns I’ve done usually get around 40K to 100K+ views. But here’s the thing... I was only being paid pennies each week. Sometimes I’d be working basically full time hours; posting, monitoring, maintaining quality, all that. And you know what? It never really hit me how draining it was until I vented to a friend who told me I might be underselling myself. Now I’m kinda questioning everything. Should I stick with Reddit marketing and just look for better clients, or should I switch niches completely...like TikTok or Instagram marketing? Honestly I’d rather stick with Reddit since that’s where I’ve built the most experience, but I feel like I need to make a change... I'd love some advice from people who are in this space. Also if anyone knows of better opportunities or directions I could take I’d definitely be open to hearing them, please! Read more Share",

Members Online • The-FrozN Can you optimize your brand for ChatGPT or Claude? Discussion This might sound a little paranoid, but I’ve been running test prompts in ChatGPT, Claude, and even Perplexity, and I swear some brands are showing up way more often than they should. Even when I ask super broad or neutral questions like “best CRM tools” or “customer retention tools,” the same names keep popping up. Meanwhile, my company with decent SEO and solid content... nothing. It’s like we don’t exist to these models. I get how SEO works, but this feels like something totally different. Are we supposed to be optimizing for AI models now too? Is generative engine optimization an actual strategy? And are there tools that even tell you how your brand shows up in these AI answers? I’ve searched tools to improve online visibility, but none that actually help you understand how language models like ChatGPT or Claude are ranking or surfacing brands. I feel like something big is shifting and barely anyone’s talking about it yet. If anyone’s already working on this, I’d love to hear what you’re seeing. Read more Share",

Members Online • Available-Swimmer-28 Should I stick with Copywriting or go “All-in”? Ladies and gentlemen, earlier this month I lost two jobs in just two days. One was an in-person role as a content writer at my city’s municipal government, and the other was a remote SEO assistant position for an affiliate site in the betting industry. Since then, I’ve been applying for new jobs, and honestly, I don’t see AI as the real threat. The real villain is the in-person model. Around 90% of openings demand it, and convincing employers that I can deliver the same results from home has been tough. I’m married, my wife is eight months pregnant, we rent our place—so no job means nothing coming in. I’ve got a solid portfolio, so that’s not the issue. At this point, I see two paths: keep pushing for another copywriting role (I even paid for LinkedIn Premium to improve my chances), or launch a new project from scratch. What’s this project? I live in a coastal capital city in Brazil, and I realized most local hotels barely use social media or even Google My Business (believe it or not). My idea is to hire a filmmaker and a designer by the day, then go prospecting hotels and offering communication packages (silver and gold). Signing these hotels would bring in quick income (as soon as the contract is closed), while giving me the structure to keep producing material and possibly renewing contracts or expanding to more clients. So yeah, I’m stuck. It’s been 24 days without a job, and I keep wondering if this strategy of starting from zero could actually work. What would you recommend? Read more Share",

Members Online • slrhvy Solving this Verizon X/Twitter Ad - help needed. Okay so, I'm running Video Ads on X/Twitter and having an issue where the in app browser loads the content underneath the ad. This only occurs on mobile, and only for Video Ads. Image Ads will instantly redirect to the destination. I tried everything under the sun and almost gave up until...I found THIS Verizon Ad that immediatly redirects outside of X, to their destination (the verizon website) this is the only Ad I've came across that has this function, and Ad Support refuses to answer why I can't reverse engineer this or replicate the result. I need some expert ideas, I've tried deeplinks,smartlinks, nothing beats the in app browser opening the destination underneath the ad on mobile. Anyone have a solution for this? You'll have to DM me for the Verizon Ad link to see it open on mobile yourself. I can also send over a direct link to one of my Ads which will not open directly even in the same format as the Verizon Ad. Thanks for any help on this! Read more Share",

Members Online • AdEmergency9820 Looking for a mentor I’m in my mid 30s and I’ve been working in Paid Social Advertising for the last 9 years. I’ve worked at many of the big 6 agencies and have worked on dozens of accounts at this point. I’ve worked for so many different clients and have managed dozens of team mates. I find that the actual account management work is not what fuels me or excites me about my work. The thing I love and have always loved is teaching. This has led me to doing speaking roles, being a mentor, creating communities for sharing knowledge and career coaching. I don’t think I want to keep doing account management work but it does pay well and I’m competent enough to do a good job at this. Mostly because I’m able to speak confidently to clients. But I am wondering these days, what else is out there for me to do with these passions I have for teaching with the experience I have in Advertising for the last 9 years. My favorite part about my day isn’t when we sell in a cool new campaign to clients but it’s when someone on my team gains a little bit more confidence with their work. I’m looking for a mentor to speak with about this career journey. Read more Share",

I spent way too much time fiddling with ad settings, convinced that if I just nailed the targeting, sales would show up. Spoiler: they didn’t. Turns out the ads weren’t the issue, my products just sucked. So I flipped it. Instead of throwing money at ads after launch, I started putting in the work before I even hit publish. AI basically became my design intern. I’d check out what was already moving on Etsy, drop those ideas into AI, and spin out new versions that leaned on proven demand but still looked original. Here’s how I make it work: Prompts. If you type “the image features…” in MidJourney, you’ll get cluttered backgrounds every time. Switching it to “the vector t-shirt design of…” and adding “white background” gives me a clean, usable result without hours of cleanup. Tools. MidJourney handles the art, but it’s terrible with text. I run the lettering through Ideogram instead so it looks professional. Then I shrink the files in Illustrator, otherwise uploads drag forever. Results. That little setup has brought me more sales than any ad campaign I ran. I’m not chasing clicks anymore, just listing products people are already searching for. Anyone else here using AI this way? What’s your go to trick? Read more Share",

Discussion I have been in the home inspection business for the last 4 years, and so far I have made enough contacts and gained a decent popularity in my territory. But what I can see now is it will take years to scale my business in the current pace. Currently I am earning approximately $80k /year, and my next goal is to reach $200k in next 2 years. I am looking for many ways to scale my business and expand to more territories. Currently I feel I can do that with better marketing practices. Can someone suggest me what should I explore.

Members Online • digitalsaini This is what I learnt in last 3 months in b2b cold calling Discussion I've been doing cold calls in b2b niche from last 3 months and these are the hard lessons which I learnt. First of all Don't call checklist - business who've 200+ employees ( better to reach out through email/ linkedin) - who're inactive on all social media, SEO from last 2 years - people who’re already doing very good in their business Have decision makers number ( don't call on sales team number) Call Accordingly - Most relevant job title for your cold outreach will depend upon the team size and industry. - For example in team size of less than 50, you can call the CEO/founder directly. - For 50+ employees reach out to CMO or relevant job title for your offer at the mid senior level. Timing matters - calling too early in morning or too late in evening is a bad idea - calling on Monday morning/Friday evening is not a good time - 12 PM to 4 PM are sweet spots Demographics - Young age founders are more likely to welcome a new type of product or service. - In Asian region, prospects don't like jokes/humour on cold calls ( go straight to the transactional value) - Business culture of a state/country will also have a impact on your cold calls ( In some regions people don't come to meetings easily) quoting a past client in their same niche will double down your meeting booking rate Pattern interruption - call them by their name e.g. Hi james, rob this side. - always specify where you find them - Ask them about their services ( james, does your company provides web development services ?) - explain who you’re and what you do under 10-15 seconds - don’t use words salesman generally use in your niche - talk like a founder not a salesperson ( don’t agree on all things what prospect says or changing your offer ) - explain your offer under 20-25 seconds - keep it conversational - try to have their emails on your CRM, ask permission to send them a google calender invite for meet ( reduce friction for booking a meeting ) Things to note - people will reject you, its normal but it is important how you get rejected. If you’re getting rejected in your first 15 seconds then it’s your script’s fault. If someone rejects after listening your complete offer then either they really don’t need that or your offer/portfolio/tone/timing is not great. - You don’t need to call 100 people a day to get meetings, I call only 25 people a day but still get good meetings, researching your prospects and having their name on the sheet is important. I checked their SEO/ paid ads and social media before calling them. In some niches, Cold email/ linkedin outreach works better than cold calling. Read more Share",

Members Online • MobilityTweezer Growing an established event Question Anyone have experience with companies like McCabe Group, Frame House, or AC Entertainment? These types of marketing companies would promote music events, festivals, etc. I work for a mid sized music festival that I feel is ready for whatever the next step is. We’re unsure what the next step is. Presently, marketing is Facebook heavy, insta, X, magazine ads(seems like a dead end), YouTube, visitors bureaus, some direct mail, partnerships with other venues (giveaways),billboards, some radio etc. and lots of free tickets to fund raiser events(local). It’s all done in house. Everything we do feels like guesses with not enough trackable data and decisions based on that. Word of mouth is our strong suit. The festival has been around for decades. Our marketing budget is small compared to big festivals, but for contemplations sake, let’s say it’s $50,000, which might not be enough for much I do realize. Any general advice about which way to steer this very established ship? If we never promoted it again it would probably be fine, just no real growth. I’m traveling right now, so I might not reply to any responses I may get, but I promise I’ll try. Thank you in advance. Read more Share",

Members Online • Nyra_Agency_01 I’ve seen a lot of founders confuse “spending more” with “growing more.” Discussion Everyone thinks scaling just means bigger budgets. But here’s what I kept noticing after running agencies and scaling brands: 🔹Hiring more SDRs doesn’t always mean more meetings 🔹Pouring more money into ads doesn’t always mean more customers 🔹Growth still feels stuck The problem isn’t budget. It’s the way things connect. When outbound creates conversations, those same people see your ads and trust you faster. When inbound ads warm up the market, your outbound team gets way better reply rates. Each side makes the other stronger, like a loop. That’s what I call a Scaling Engine. Not “more spend,” just better systems. 👉 Curious, do you usually scale by spending more, or by fixing your systems? Read more Share",

Question I’m looking for some perspective from others who’ve been in similar shoes. Sorry, this will be a bit of a rant but I need some input from people who actually know whats normal. I’m a one-person marketing team at a fast-growing tech startup. On paper, it’s exciting: there’s budget, freedom to experiment, and I’m not afraid of little-to-no direction. But the dynamics are messy, and I’m struggling with how to position myself. Reporting lines are weird. I report to the Chief of People (because “the CEO has no time”). She’s involved in everything (leadership team, finances, etc.) and pushes hard without fully understanding what I do. Small things she cares about, big-picture she doesn’t. If I explain too much, I’m “too detailed.” If I don’t, she wants more. She pushes for things sooner. I get it, but why is she the one pushing? She doesn't understand anything I do? Who makes the rules here, her or the CEO or the investors or sales? She wants to be involved everywhere, but also not at all. Either way, every meeting we have I am a nervous wreck. Its a lose-lose. CEO is the visionary. He’s creative, full of ideas, and honestly the one I think I should be closer to. But he rarely responds to me. Meetings are rare and turn into last-minute “info/idea/vision dumps” where ANY structure I bring gets derailed. I really do try. But it's to no avail. I try and structure what I get from his info dumps, but it's really hard to get anything done this way. I usually bring something prepared which is specific, and he zooms out to an ungodly extent and talks about everything else around that plus 10000 more ideas and hyper specific inputs. Investors & sales. Investors push their own agenda and want things now. Sales is just one senior guy who flipped out when I tried a simple persona and ICP exercise and how its 'bullshit'. I’m trying to build the basics—story, ICP, messaging, SEO, website, even some sales processes—but I either get ignored, pushed, or people aren’t willing to do the work. For example, they push for a CRM system - and then flip out in the meeting about 'how unnecessarily complicated it is' or how much input they have to give me. When really its basics that I am asking for. How can I build a sales pipeline and Hubspot - if we never discussed how we define an MQL/SQL - what we need at each step etc. Logistics. I get 2 days home office (was hoping for more) but the commute is 2 hours each way. Whenever I ask for more flexibility, it’s not well received. Most people do go to the office mainly and have same amount of home office as me or just 1 day. But the sales guy who screams around for no reason, is always in home office. I would go more if needed, but many days I am there, and I literally talk to noone. The only calls I have, are with external people. I might as well do that at home. Why waste 4 hours of the day if I'm not going to talk to anyone there? The projects themselves usually end up good in the end, but it’s always last-minute chaos and way more stressful than it needs to be. So my questions: Is this just startup life and I need to embrace the chaos? Or should I be setting harder boundaries / clarifying ownership? How do you handle reporting to someone who doesn’t “get” marketing while the visionary who does won’t give you time? Would love to hear how other marketing people in early-stage companies have navigated this and if you have any advice for me. Read more Share",

I just saw one on Facebook — it was a brand I've never heard of promoting a product I’d never buy. I'm not the brand’s target audience, and that brand is missing out by not understanding who to market their product towards. No company can market to everyone — so who are you selling to? That's the question that your target audience answers. Good targeting speaks directly to a specific group, making viewers feel connected with the brand. Understanding target audiences is key to any successful marketing strategy. Every product and service has a target audience, no matter how niche. In this article, I'll walk you through how to perform a target audience analysis for your brand. Table of Contents What is a target audience? Target Market vs Target Audience Types of Target Audiences How to Find Your Target Audience Target Audience Examples What is a target audience? “Target audience” refers to a group of consumers characterized by shared qualities like demographic data, behaviors, interests, etc. Most companies and products will have multiple target audiences representing diverse products and user groups. Brands identify their target consumers by articulating audience features to create a clear picture of who the potential customer is. This image clarifies brand messaging, focuses marketing efforts, and even guides what products to develop next. For example, a wine company can't sell to both high-end wine aficionados and novice wine drinkers. Through target audience research, they could identify their target wine drinkers as those ages 24 to 30 who have an interest in wine but limited budgets. Knowing their audi",

Do you think that Google is still relevant, or should I go all in on TikTok?&rdquo; The short answer to your question is that you do not want to pigeonhole your business into one channel, no matter the size. There&rsquo;s also no such thing as an &ldquo;easier&rdquo; way. They are all hard. I&rsquo;m going to get the obvious out of the way so we can get to something beyond the usual answers to this question. Your brand should be where your audience is. Great, now that we didn&rsquo;t spend four paragraphs saying the same thing that&rsquo;s been said 100 times before, let me tell you something you want to consider beyond &ldquo;be where your audience is.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s Not About Channel, It&rsquo;s About Traction I have a lot of opinions here, so let me just &ldquo;channel&rdquo; my inner Big Lebowski and preface this with ... this is just my opinion, man. Stop thinking about channels. That&rsquo;s way down the funnel (yet marketers make channels the seminal question all the time). Start thinking about traction. How do you generate the most traction? When I say &ldquo;traction,&rdquo; what I really mean is how to start resonating with your audience so that the &ldquo;chatter&rdquo; and momentum about who you are compound so that new doors of opportunity open up. The answer to that question is not, &ldquo;We will focus on TikTok.&rdquo; The answer is also not, &ldquo;We will focus on Google.&rdquo; The answer is also not, &ldquo;We will focus on YouTube.&rdquo; I could go on. Now, there is another side to this: resources and operations. The question is, how do you balance traction with the amount of resources you have? For smaller brands, I would think about: What can you do to gain traction that bigger brands have a hard time with? For example, big brands have a very hard time with video content . They have all sorts of production standards, operations, and a litany of people who have a say, who shouldn&rsquo;t even be in sniffing distance of having a say. They can&rsquo;t simply turn on their phone, record a video, and share something of value. You can. Does that mean you should focus on TikTok? Nope. It means you should think about what you can put out there that would resonate and help your audience, and does that work for the format? If so, you may want to go with video shorts . I&rsquo;m not sure why you would limit",

SEJ STAFF Roger Montti August 21, 2025 ⋅ 5 min read SEJ STAFF Roger Montti Owner - Martinibuster.com at Martinibuster.com Bio Follow 24 SHARES 6.1K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Patchstack published a case study that examined how well Cloudflare and other general firewall and malware solutions protected WordPress websites from common vulnerability threats and attack vectors. The research showed that while general solutions stopped threats like SQL injection or cross-site scripting, a dedicated WordPress security solution consistently stopped WordPress-specific exploits at a significantly higher rate. WordPress Vulnerabilities Due to the popularity of the WordPress platform, WordPress plugins and themes are a common focus for hackers, and vulnerabilities can quickly be exploited in the wild. Once proof-of-concept code is public, attackers often act within hours, leaving website owners little time to react. This is why it is critical to be aware of the security provided by a web host and of how effective those solutions are in a WordPress environment. Methodology Patchstack explained their methodology: &ldquo;As a baseline, we have decided to host &ldquo;honeypot&rdquo; sites (sites against which we will perform controlled pentesting with a set of 11 WordPress-specific vulnerabilities) with 5 distinct hosting providers, some of which have ingrained features presuming to help with blocking WordPress vulnerabilities and/or overall security. In addition to the hosting provider&rsquo;s security measures and third-party providers for additional measures like robust WAFs or other patching providers, we have also installed Patchstack on every site, with our test question being: How many of these threats will bypass firewalls and other patching providers to ultimately reach Patchstack? And will Patchstack be able to block them all successfully?&rdquo; Testing process Each website was set up the same way, with identical plugins, versions, and settings. Patchstack used a &ldquo;exploitation testing toolkit&rdquo; to run the same exploit tests in the same order on every site. Results were checked automatically and by hand to see if attacks were stopped, and whether the block came from the host&rsquo;s defenses or from Patchstack. General Overview: Hosting Providers Versus Vulnerabilities The Patchstack case study tested five different configurations of security defenses, plus Patchstack. 1. Hosting Provider A Plus Cloudflare WAF 2. Hosting Provider B + Firewall + Monarx Server and Website Security 3. Hosting Provider C + Firewall + Imunify Web Server Security 4.

The vulnerability arises due to a missing or incorrect security validation that enables an unauthenticated attacker to launch a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) A CSRF vulnerability in the context of a WordPress site is an attack that relies on a user with admin privileges clicking a link, which in turn leverages that user&rsquo;s credentials to execute a malicious action. The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS threat rating of 8.1. The advisory issued by Wordfence WordPress security company warned: &ldquo;This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install plugins from the repository via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.&rdquo; The vulnerability affects Inspiro theme versions up to and including 2.1.2.

See where your ads run, review placements, and decide if Search Partners deserve a place in your budget.

Until now, advertisers could only opt in or out, with little understanding of where their ads actually showed. This update finally gives visibility into where budgets are spent outside of Google. Google lists this as an August 2025 update in its Help Center, however it wasn&rsquo;t announced widespread. Read on to understand the update from Google, how advertisers are reacting, and what you can do with this new level of information. What Changed in Search Partner Reporting? The new reporting applies to Search, Shopping, and App campaigns. You&rsquo;ll now see which partner sites served your ads and how many impressions each one received. Think of it as the kind of placement data we already get in Performance Max, just extended to Search Partners. This update follows other moves Google has made to address long-standing concerns about partner quality. Earlier this year, they introduced brand safety pre-screening options with IAS, DoubleVerify, and Zefr. They also said parked domains will be opted out by default before the end of 2025. This visibility layer feels like the missing piece that makes the rest of those updates more usable. How Are Advertisers Reacting to This Update? The update on Search Partner Network reporting was first found by Anthony Higman, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his opinion. Higman stated: Still Most Likely Wont Be Participating In The Search Partner Network But This Is Unprecedented And What ALL Advertisers Have Been Requesting For Decades! Honestly NEVER Thought I Would See This Day.&rdquo; Others gave some versioning mixture of applauding Google for giving data to advertisers that they&rsquo;ve been asking for for years, while also being somewhat skeptical. Mike Ryan replied to Higman with his thoughts: I mean, good step but also, it&rsquo;s the PMax version: impression data only. Aaron Levy shared his thoughts on LinkedIn , stating that this is a major step in the right direction for Google. Why This Matters & How to Take Action Without Search Partner Network reporting, it was tough to justify opting in. Now advertisers finally have data to audit where ads run, decide if it fits brand standards, and see if partner traffic adds any real value. That said, the update is only as good as the action that advertisers take with the information available. Some sites won&rsquo;t align with brand guidelines. Others may generate c",

    "essence": "The B2B SEO Trap: Why High-Intent Visibility Can Still Underperform Quality visibility that leads to quality bottom-funnel visits matters for B2B SEO. Not all bottom-of-the-funnel traffic converts, and that is ok. VIP CONTRIBUTOR Corey Morris August 20, 2025 ⋅ 10 min read VIP CONTRIBUTOR Corey Morris President / CEO at Voltage Bio Follow 36 SHARES 1.4K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> In B2B SEO, typically, the ultimate goal is to attract high-intent searchers who convert into qualified leads . But, not all high-intent visibility translates to sales-ready traffic, especially in long sales cycles or complex buying journeys. As we get deeper into an era of diminishing importance of keywords that translate directly into attributable clicks, a focus on quality of traffic is as important as ever. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. Quality has long been a critical component and key performance indicator (KPI) in the sense that most of us know our conversion rates and stages of the funnel someone might be in related to intent with B2B and lead generation. However, now, as much as ever, we have to scrutinize intent and the traffic quality even more. When SEO teams over-prioritize high-intent visibility and focus under the false assumption that intent equals urgency, we can find that we&rsquo;re not getting the conversions or leads that we expect. In this article, I&rsquo;m unpacking seven ways to help go deeper with mapping visibility to actual funnel stages, differentiating decision-makers vs. influencers, and building SEO content that nurtures, qualifies, and educates before the handoff to sales. 1. The Myth: &ldquo;If It&rsquo;s A Bottom-Of-Funnel Topic, The Traffic Is Ready To Convert&rdquo; While we may think about our website, our content, and analytics data in customer journeys and conversion funnels , our target audience doesn&rsquo;t. Maybe my nerdy search brain thinks that way when I&rsquo;m consuming content on a website I&rsquo;m interested in, but most of the world doesn&rsquo;t. There are too many variables that impact someone&rsquo;s conversion decision to fully unpack here. I can personally tell you that a couple of times, I filled out forms while lying on the floor next to one of my kids in bed, falling asleep. And, other times, I sat with a tab open on my giant desktop work monitor for months before eventually finding that tab again and filling out the form. Those are two extreme examples, but as more possible ways to be found (e.g., AI search) enter play, we&rsquo;re going to see myriad behaviors and paths that we couldn&rsquo;t have anticipated just a few years ago. Things are not going to make sense in a simple way, and what might seem like a home run conversion will be frustrating when you dig into the data, and things that might have felt like top of funnel that convert quickly will be equally (but pleasantly) surprising as well. 2.

    "essence": "Quality Audiences: Why Lower Traffic Might Be Better More traffic doesn’t always mean more value. Learn why attracting fewer, but better, visitors may be the smarter move for real business impact. Chelsea Alves August 20, 2025 ⋅ 12 min read Chelsea Alves Senior Manager, Content Marketing at Forsta Bio Follow 21 SHARES 2.0K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> There once was a time when digital marketers chased traffic. The more traffic a website attracted, the more marketers felt satisfied and closer to attaining their goals. But, this once golden metric is no longer a tell-tale sign of success. Gone are the days of forecasting growth solely on the number of visitors coming to a website. Today, lower traffic might actually be better than driving a plethora of unqualified, uninterested leads to your website. Undoubtedly, consumer search behavior looks much different than it once did. AI is stealing click-throughs, third-party cookies are essentially disappearing, and audiences give more thought to whether to click through to a website. Quality over quantity is the name of the game, and marketers are now shifting their focus towards driving better traffic rather than more traffic. In this post, we&rsquo;ll dissect why less traffic might be &ldquo;more&rdquo; and better for your business, how to shift your content marketing strategy to attract high-quality visitors, and share actionable insights for driving business results with your target audience. Table of Contents 1. The Traffic Trap: Why More Isn&rsquo;t Always Better 2. AI Has Forever Changed The Search Landscape 3. The Power Of Qualified Traffic 4. Quality Content = Better Business Outcomes 5. The Go-To Content Marketing Strategy To Drive Qualified Traffic 6. Quality Will Win The Future Of Content Marketing The Traffic Trap: Why More Isn&rsquo;t Always Better At first thought, a high volume of traffic sounds ideal. The thought of hundreds of thousands of visitors flooding your site and purchasing your products or services would be a dream. But, that&rsquo;s unfortunately not reality in most cases. It&rsquo;s a vanity metric that looks impressive in presentations but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily move the needle when it comes to sales. According to a recent study, the average website conversion rate across 14 different industries is a dismal 3.3% . That means for every 1,000 visitors, fewer than 25 of those will actually convert. And, depending on your sector, your conversion rate might be even lower. Additionally, consider if your content isn&rsquo;t optimized for the right keywords. You could be attracting traffic with zero intention or motivation to convert. In this case, these searchers are likely to bounce once they realize what you&rsquo;re selling, they have no interest in buying. The numbers may look inflated, but if the quality is lacking, those numbers are meaningless. At the end of the day, sales and revenue are the ultimate goals for any business. Drawing in the right audience leads you closer to that goal, even if the numbers aren&rsquo;t legendary. Because here&rsquo;s an uncomfortable truth: Traffic is easy to obtain; quality traffic is hard. AI Has Forever Changed The Search Landscape There&rsquo;s been much discussion around the impact of AI in the search landscape , and even some of the most seasoned SEOs are scratching their heads, wondering what to do. Google&rsquo;s rollout of AI Overviews and the rising use of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools have significantly altered the way users search for products and services. Searchers no longer need to click through on a website to get the information they need. Instead, they&rsquo;re receiving AI-generated summaries that often answer their question right away. This has resulted in businesses across the board seeing a notable decrease in traffic. Even top-ranking content that&rsquo;s been thriving in the search engine results pages (SERPs) for years has taken a hit. Bustle, the entertainment and lifestyle site, saw search traffic behave erratically last spring, around the time AI summaries were introduced. Some stories surged to 150,000-300,000 views , while most others barely cracked 1,000. In turn, SEOs and content marketers are being forced to face a new reality – what many are referring to as &ldquo;zero-click search 2.0.&rdquo; But, just as we have done with all the previous major changes in the search landscapes, the good news is we&rsquo;ll live and we&rsquo;ll adapt. It takes a mindset shift, where instead of relying on high-ranking content to drive traffic, the new goal must be to create valuable, intent-focused content that targets long-tail queries, offers helpful information, solves a problem, and is well-written (which means not relying on AI to fully draft content for you). Subject matter experts are in higher demand than ever before as relevance and trust become more paramount than ever before. The Power Of Qualified Traffic When we talk about qualified traffic, it&rsquo;s important to clearly define what exactly this means, as it can have divergent definitions. For the purposes of this post, quality audiences include searchers who: Match and align with your target personas and demographic. Arrive with specific intent (ready to make a purchase or are further along in the sales journey). Engage meaningfully with your content (visiting multiple pages on your site, higher dwell times). Often find you through word-of-mouth, email, referrals, reviews, or targeted search. Use long-tail queries to help them solve a problem they&rsquo;re facing. Now, think about the content you&rsquo;re creating and what&rsquo;s in your pipeline. If you&rsquo;re drafting generic blog posts, surface-level articles, or are relying entirely on AI to draft your content for you, you may be attracting visitors, but you likely aren&rsquo;t motivating buyers. The same can be said for advertising efforts that cast too wide of a net. The result? An influx of searchers that may have no intention of converting and no interest in your business. Your traffic count may look great, but there&rsquo;s no success behind drawing in these visitors. Consider that an email marketing provider found that email marketing has an average return on investment (ROI) of $36 for every $1 spent . It&rsquo;s well known and documented that email marketing tends to be one of the highest drivers of ROI. The reason for this is that your email audience is usually pre-qualified and opted in to receive communication from you. They know your business and what you sell, and are therefore more likely to take action. Similarly, referral traffic and direct traffic often yield higher conversion rates than social media or display ads. Getting the right people to your site is essential, and the tactics that accomplish this should be your primary focus. Quality Content = Better Business Outcomes There&rsquo;s a reason why nearly half of technology companies say their content marketing budgets will grow this year . Because content works – when it&rsquo;s done right. Content shouldn&rsquo;t be created to cast a wider net. It should be created with intentionality to grow your brand recognition , build trust with your audience, and offer the type of value that keeps people coming back. Here&rsquo;s how quality, helpful content focused on the right audience and pain points pays off: 1. Higher Conversion Rates Personalized content is a powerful driver of consumer behavior. In fact, 76% of people say tailored content influences their decision to consider a brand, and 78% say it makes them more likely to buy again. This statistic highlights the need for content that&rsquo;s personalized and targeted to searchers&rsquo; needs. Content that speaks to a specific persona or pain point is more likely to convert than a pointless listicle that&rsquo;s stuffed with basic information. 2. Improved Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) You don&rsquo;t want your customers to be one and done. Instead, you want them to come back to you any time the need arises. You want to be the brand they choose and trust over your competitors. When you draft content that is deeply relevant, helps users understand your products, educates them on all your services, or guides them towards making a more informed decision, they&rsquo;re likely to keep returning for more. 3. Lower Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) No salesperson wants to sit through a multi-year process, anxiously awaiting the day a prospect may or may not decide to move forward. Targeted content and lower funnel content attract qualified leads that lead to shorter sales cycles and lower the cost to acquire a new customer. This empowers sales teams to focus on closing rather than convincing, educating, or determining if a prospect is worth their while. 4. Stronger Brand Equity When customers find your content to be valuable, they&rsquo;re more likely to share your content with their followers on social media and refer you to their friends. Bridging the gap between awareness and consideration means building trust and drafting insightful, research-backed content. This is why content drafting can&rsquo;t be left solely to AI but should be left in the hands of skilled human writers who&rsquo;ve consulted subject matter experts to deliver the highest value content possible. Content Quality Indicators As aforementioned, traffic alone isn&rsquo;t enough to measure the quality of your content. There are numerous signals that can help you assess whether your content is working. A few key metrics content marketers should assess when evaluating the strength of their content marketing efforts include: Bounce Rate: The bigger the bounce rate, the bigger the concern. According to Siege Media, a good bounce rate for a blog is 70%, with the average being 80% . Anything more, and there is likely a fatal flaw between content and audience expectations that should be examined. Scroll Depth: Similar to bounce rate, it&rsquo;s unhelpful if your browsers aren&rsquo;t scrolling down enough to potentially become buyers. This could suggest myriad issues, such as your call to action (CTA) being too far down on the page or your content not resonating with your target audience. Time on Page: Are customers coming to your website but leaving shortly after? Short sessions on your website may imply low engagement, or your content simply isn&rsquo;t relevant to the audience. This is often the case when your keywords don&rsquo;t align with search intent, which raises the importance of thorough keyword research. Conversion Pathways: Each of your website pages likely has the goal of getting people to take action, whether that&rsquo;s filling out a form, requesting a demo, or purchasing a product. If people aren&rsquo;t clicking your CTAs, it&rsquo;s important to assess what the problem is. Perhaps your CTA is the wrong color or doesn&rsquo;t use compelling language. A/B testing can help you assess where the real problem lies. These metrics help you understand not just how many people arrived, but how many stayed and why. The Go-To Content Marketing Strategy To Drive Qualified Traffic It&rsquo;s time for a mind shift for content marketers. We&rsquo;re not abandoning growth, and we&rsquo;re not neglecting traffic, but we&rsquo;re being more intentional about our goals. More traffic doesn&rsquo;t mean more sales. It&rsquo;s time to redefine our strategies to secure success and highlight content marketing as a value-add. Here&rsquo;s the new playbook for driving qualified traffic: 1. Redefine What Success Looks Like Success looks different today than it did even a few years ago. Today, success is contingent on attracting quality leads, keeping people on your website, assessing the time to conversion, and digging into your content engagement rates. We&rsquo;re also looking at any red flags in user experience, such as long page load times, CTAs that are too far down, and intrusive ads popping up. 2. Segment Your Audience Your target audience is likely diverse, which means they inherently have different needs and preferences. To ensure your content hits the mark, it&rsquo;s crucial to segment your audience appropriately by buyer personas, new versus returning users, behavioral signals, age, and more to ensure your content lands. For example, a Gen Z customer searching for a financial services business will want vastly different information than a Boomer, who may be looking for information about retirement or estate planning. 3. Align Content With The Funnel Content must be created for all stages of the funnel. For example, a first-time buyer will likely want more awareness-level content, whereas someone at the decision stage likely wants to read case studies or product reviews. Audit your existing content to ensure you have a healthy mix of content at each stage of the funnel, including: Top of Funnel (ToFu): Awareness content that builds trust and captures attention (but should still target a specific persona). Middle of Funnel (MoFu): Educational content that helps users compare solutions, such as whitepapers, ebooks, product one-pagers, and more. Bottom of Funnel (BoFu): Case studies, reviews and testimonials, product demos, and more. 4. Invest In First-Party Data Knowing who&rsquo;s interested in your business can help you reach the right people at the right time. First-party data is invaluable, and can be sourced through email subscribers, webinar attendees, and form fills. These are the people your business wants to develop relationships with, and can do so through drip campaigns, feedback loops, and tailored content offers. 5. Optimize For Intent, Not Just Keywords Informational keywords can be helpful, but they often aren&rsquo;t going to lead to quick conversions. It can be helpful to focus on human-centered SEO , long-tail keywords (which usually are specific and solve a problem), and other types of intent-based keywords. Leverage third-party tools like Semrush, Ahrefs, or MarketMuse to uncover the why behind searches, how competitive search terms are, and how often they&rsquo;re searched for. Quality Will Win The Future Of Content Marketing In a digital-first era that&rsquo;s rife with competition, it&rsquo;s necessary to differentiate your business from others. While your competitors may be generating content quickly and at scale using AI, your brand can gain a competitive edge by doubling down on authenticity and building human-first content. Lower traffic may be getting your business down, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to lower value. In fact, for many brands, trimming the fat and focusing on quality audiences only leads to greater wins. The next time you&rsquo;re analyzing your data and notice a dip in traffic, there&rsquo;s no need to get into panic mode. Ask yourself: Did the right people visit? Is our content useful? Are these visitors driving growth? After all, traffic is just a number.

Ahrefs Traffic Analysis The dashboard states: &ldquo;ChatGPT is growing 3.8x faster than Google.&rdquo; It adds: &ldquo;With 5.3% monthly growth vs Google&rsquo;s 1.4% in the latest month, AI-powered search continues to evolve rapidly.&rdquo; And: &ldquo;ChatGPT now drives measurable referral traffic to websites, representing a new channel that didn&rsquo;t exist 2 years ago.&rdquo; How The Data Is Collected To keep the time series comparable, the tracker includes only sites that appear in all months. As the page explains: &ldquo;Our analysis tracks sites that appear in all months, ensuring statistically significant and reliable growth metrics.&rdquo; The page also lists the last update timestamp and confirms monthly updates. Important Caveats The dashboard measures referral traffic that arrives with a referrer. Some AI systems and in-app browsers add noreferrer or otherwise strip referrers, which can undercount AI-originating visits. Ahrefs has documented this analytics blind spot when measuring AI assistants and Google&rsquo;s AI Mode. Keep that limitation in mind when comparing &ldquo;AI search&rdquo; activity to traditional search. Scope matters too. The cohort is limited to sites using Ahrefs Web Analytics. Earlier Ahrefs research across different samples found AI referrals around 0.17% of the average site&rsquo;s traffic, which is directionally consistent with the 0.19% shown here. Looking Ahead Google still sends the overwhelming share of visits in this dataset, and that reality should anchor your priorities. At the same time, ChatGPT&rsquo;s July growth suggests an emerging, measurable channel you can evaluate with real data. Use the tracker to watch how both lines move over time and adjust your testing accordingly. Featured Image: JRdes /Shutterstock Category News Tools",

    "essence": "WordPress Contact Form 7 Redirection Plugin Vulnerability Hits 300k Sites High-severity vulnerability affects Redirection for Contact Form 7 plugin installed on over 300,000 WordPress sites SEJ STAFF Roger Montti August 19, 2025 ⋅ 2 min read SEJ STAFF Roger Montti Owner - Martinibuster.com at Martinibuster.com Bio Follow 25 SHARES 3.3K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> A vulnerability advisory was issued for a WordPress Contact Form 7 add-on plugin that enables unauthenticated attackers to &ldquo;easily&rdquo; launch a remote code execution. The vulnerability is rated high (8.8/10) on the CVSS threat severity scale. Screenshot from Wordfence advisory showing 8.8 CVSS severity rating Redirection for Contact Form 7 plugin The vulnerability affects the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin, which is installed on over 300,000 websites. The plugin extends the functionality of the popular Contact Form 7 plugin. It enables a website publisher not only to redirect a user to another page but also to store the information in a database, send email notifications, and block spammy form submissions. The vulnerability arises in a plugin function. WordPress functions are PHP code snippets that provide specific functionalities. The specific function that contains the flaw is called the delete_associated_files function. That function contains an insufficient file path validation flaw, which means it does not validate what a user can input into the function that deletes files. This flaw enables an attacker to specify a path to a file to be deleted. Thus, an attacker can specify a path (such as ../../wp-config.php) and delete a critical file like wp-config.php, clearing the way for a remote code execution (RCE) attack. An RCE attack is a type of exploit that enables an attacker to execute malicious code remotely (from anywhere on the Internet) and gain control of the website. The Wordfence advisory explains : &ldquo;This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).&rdquo; The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including version 3.2.4. Users of the affected plugin are advised to update the plugin to the latest version. Featured Image by Shutterstock/Everyonephoto Studio Category News WordPress",

    "essence": "Home Marketing Marketing without the cringe: Jayde Powell on Gen Z audiences Marketing without the cringe: Jayde Powell on Gen Z audiences Plus: The anti-cringe marketing checklist Written by: Laura M. Browning Updated: 08/05/25 I am “just threw out my back while turning to adjust my seatbelt” years old, so I was especially excited to talk to Jayde Powell, who’s made a name for herself as a bit of a Gen Z whisperer. I am also chronically online, so I’m aware of a lot of the Gen Z slang/memes/jokes that wend their way through the fiber optics. But does that mean I should start addressing Masters in Marketing newsletters, “Heyyyy besties!”? (Don’t worry, I’m not going to start doing that; it’s safe to hit that subscribe button below.) Powell is also one of our featured speakers at INBOUND next month, so if you love her marketing lessons — and I think you will! — come join us in San Francisco . Meet the Master Jayde Powell Creatorpreneur and the founder and head of creative, The Em Dash Co Claim to fame: Jayde made $100k+ last year — just from creating content on LinkedIn. Fun fact: She plans to retire by the time she’s 40. “If you see me [on social when I’m 40], it’s because I have a team managing my social media presence.” Lesson 1: Use influencers to reach new audiences — not existing ones. Influencer marketing doesn’t have to be expensive — think micro influencers with niche audiences — but if you’re like most marketers right now, your budget is still probably feeling a bit squeezed. That can make it extra hard to relinquish control over how your brand is presented to the world. But you gotta let go: Let influencers “speak to their audience in the way they’re used to,” Powell says, otherwise you could be flushing your hard-won budget down the drain. “What you're doing when you work with influencers is — you're trying to reach new audiences, not your existing customers .” If you wanted the influencers to sound like your brand, “then it’s a waste of money,” Powell says. “You could have just had that asset made in-house.” “It doesn‘t make sense for a creator or influencer to all of a sudden start posting this branded asset that doesn’t even sound like them. It's going to confuse their audience,” she tells me. Powell says that the last thing you — or the influencer, for that matter — want is for followers to ask, “Why is this sponsored content on my feed? That’s how you lose their trust.” “To put it simply, let your creators and your influencers cook. Let them do their thing.” Lesson 2: You don’t need to be a part of every moment. It’s only been a couple of weeks since the Coldplay concert incident revealed a CEO’s affair to the world… followed by dozens of major brands trying to get in on the action on social. But does your brand need to be a part of it? Source Maybe! But also, let’s be honest, maybe not. Brands are “rushing to be a part of the conversation because obviously there's a pressure of relevancy to maintain on social,” Powell tells me. “But that‘s where brands need to remember that you don���t actually need to be a part of every moment. It’s okay to take a step back and just be an observer — learn from the conversation rather than being a part of it .” It’s not that you should actively avoid whatever’s floating through the zeitgeist this week. “You want to move at the speed of culture,” Powell acknowledges. She recommends finding a balance of “figuring out where and when to engage, and how.” (Pro tip : It’s probably not at a Coldplay concert.) Lesson 3: Don’t be cringe. You may well associate slang like “cringe” and “delulu” with Gen Z. But, Powell reminds me, “Gen Z is our most multicultural generation yet,” so “Gen Z” isn’t just shorthand for “the youth.” A lot of Gen Z lingo is born from that multiculturalism, often originating in queer and Black culture. So if your century-old legacy brand suddenly starts claiming you’ve “left no crumbs,” you might think you’re reaching a younger audience — but you might not realize that the term originated in Black and Latino queer culture . “Brands start adopting [slang] because they want to flex their tone and voice and be a little bit more relatable to Gen Z. But in the effort to be relatable, there's something that kind of gets lost in the process,” Powell says. A good rule of thumb? If it’s not part of your brand voice already, best to skip it. If you want to expand your market share into new communities, consider working with multicultural agencies that can help you keep your foot out of your mouth. If that’s not in the budget, Powell also suggests “utilizing the research that’s [already] available, like Pew Research or Statista,” which put out “a lot of reports around multicultural audiences.” And instead of zeroing in on a specific phrase or iconography you want to use, reframe your approach: Use the existing research to examine “what are the best ways to actually speak to [Gen Z] and how you should be marketing to them.” The Anti-Cringe Marketing Checklist Keep one on hand or share it with your team, and learn how to market authentically without the cringe.

Download Now Lingering Questions This Week’s Question You’ve built an incredible reputation for understanding Gen Z behavior and creating authentic, community-first content. In a world that’s constantly chasing virality, how do you balance consistency with creativity, and what advice would you give to brands trying to build genuine relationships over time, not JUST reach? — Sheena Hakimian , senior digital consumer marketing at Condé Nast and certified life coach This Week’s Answer Powell says: Remember that there‘s a difference between consistency and cadence. Oftentimes I feel, especially as it relates to building community on social, that there’s this mentality that the more content you pump out, the more you engage with people — and the more beneficial it is for your brand. And I disagree. I think what people are looking for is a sense of comfort, a sense of home, a sense of familiarity. And that's what you can accomplish through consistency. Consistency is less about how much and how often you're putting content out and more about the feelings that your audience will associate with your brand. So it could literally be something as simple as the style and the tone in which you communicate or create your content. It could be the visuals you use. It can be how you greet your audience when you post — those are the things that really build community. Think of it as like a relationship. You're not in a relationship with someone just because of the amount of things that they do for you, it's how they do it for you. That's the same way it should be for your community.

The 2024 Marketing Technology Landscape revealed a staggering 14,106 martech products available, representing 27.8% growth year-over-year. But here's the uncomfortable truth: marketers estimate they waste an average of 26% of their budgets on ineffective channels and strategies, with about half of respondents saying they misspend at least 20% of their budgets. Businesses using 15+ marketing apps can consolidate to a unified platform without losing functionality while reducing costs and improving team efficiency. This isn‘t about sacrificing capability — it’s about strategic consolidation that maintains 95% of your functionality while dramatically cutting waste. And the problem isn't just financial. Gartner reports that average marketing budgets dropped from 9.1% of company revenue in 2023 to 7.7% in 2024, putting enormous pressure on teams to do more with less. Meanwhile, your marketing stack has become a Frankenstein monster of disconnected tools that creates more problems than it solves. Table of Contents The Problem: When More Tools Mean Less Results The 10-Phase Consolidation Framework: From Chaos to Clarity What 95% Functionality Retention Actually Means Example Tool Consolidation Comparison Tables Advanced Marketing Tool Consolidation Strategies: Beyond the Basics Maintaining Functionality During Transition Example ROI Calculation: Proving Consolidation Success Common Marketing Tool Consolidation Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them HubSpot's Free CRM Software Free CRM Software & Tools for Your Whole Team Sales Marketing Operations Customer Service Get free CRM The Problem: When More Tools Mean Less Results Why Teams Resist Consolidation Marketing teams accumulate tools for legitimate reasons. Each platform promised to solve a specific problem, and individual team members developed expertise in their preferred tools. But this organic growth creates three critical issues: Data silos: Customer information scattered across platforms prevents comprehensive customer understanding Integration nightmares: Manual data transfers and broken connections waste countless hours Hidden redundancies: Multiple tools performing similar functions without anyone realizing the overlap According to research by Proxima , up to 60% of marketing budgets are wasted due to inefficiencies in execution and planning. The waste isn‘t just monetary, it’s operational, strategic, and psychological. The Most Common Marketing Apps Creating Sprawl Before diving into consolidation, let's identify the typical culprits. Most mid-sized marketing teams use variations of these 15+ tools. Content & Creative Tools 1. Graphic design and visual content 2. Professional design and video editing suites 3. Video recording and screen sharing 4. Writing assistance and proofreading Social Media Management 5. Social media scheduling and management suites 6. Social media publishing and analytics systems 7. Social listening and engagement monitoring tools Email & Automation 8. Email marketing campaign management tools 9. Email automation and CRM tools 10. Creator-focused email marketing tools Analytics & SEO 11. Website traffic analysis tools 12. SEO and competitive research tools 13. Backlink analysis and keyword research tools Sales & CRM 14. Customer relationship management 15. Sales pipeline management Additional Specialty Tools 16. Meeting scheduling calendar tools 17. Internal team communication channels 18. Project management platforms The 10-Phase Consolidation Framework: From Chaos to Clarity [Example] Phase 1: Comprehensive Tool Audit and Usage Analysis Time to complete: 1-2 weeks Expected savings: Immediate visibility into $10,000-50,000 annual waste Start with a complete inventory of every marketing tool your organization pays for. A recent Slack/Salesforce survey found the average small business owner juggles four different digital tools daily, and this contributes to inefficiency—29% end up repeating messages across platforms and 30% spend time searching across multiple systems. Action steps: List every marketing software subscription and cost Document actual user adoption rates (not just licenses purchased) Track time spent switching between platforms daily Identify data export/import requirements for each tool Red flags to watch for: Tools with less than 50% team adoption Monthly costs exceeding $100 for underutilized features Duplicate functionality across platforms Manual data entry between systems Phase 2: Functionality Mapping and Gap Analysis Time to complete: 1 week Expected savings: Clear picture of feature redundancy worth $5,000-20,000 annually Create a comprehensive map of what each tool actually does versus what you thought it did when you bought it. Most teams discover they‘re using 30% or less of their software’s capabilities. Critical questions: Which features do you actively use versus pay for? Where do workflows break down between tools? What manual processes exist because tools don't integrate? Which team members are “power users” versus “login occasionally” users? Phase 3: Team Resistance Assessment and Change Management Time to complete: 2 weeks ongoing Expected savings: Avoiding failed implementations worth $25,000+ in wasted time Why teams resist consolidation goes beyond simple preference. Understanding these psychological barriers is crucial for successful consolidation: Expertise investment: Team members have invested time learning specific tools Workflow disruption: Fear that consolidation will slow down current processes Feature loss anxiety: Concern about losing specialized capabilities Control issues: Worries about having less autonomy over tool selection Change management strategy: Identify “tool champions” who can become consolidation advocates Document current pain points and inefficiencies Create side-by-side feature comparisons showing maintained capabilities Establish clear communication about what functionality will be preserved Phase 4: Unified Platform Evaluation and Selection Time to complete: 2-3 weeks Expected savings: Avoiding wrong platform choice worth $50,000+ in migration costs When consolidation isn't the answer: If your team requires highly specialized tools for technical SEO, advanced video editing, or industry-specific compliance, partial consolidation may be more appropriate than full unification. Platform evaluation criteria: Native integration capabilities API availability and reliability Data migration support and tools Training resources and learning curve Scalability for future growth Total cost of ownership (not just license fees) Real-world success example: Liquidity Services consolidated eight different software tools onto HubSpot and reduced their overall costs by 50% . The key was choosing a platform that could handle their complex, multi-marketplace sales and marketing operations without losing the specialized features each team needed. Phase 5: Data Migration Strategy and Execution Time to complete: 3-4 weeks Expected savings: Avoiding data loss and rebuild costs worth $30,000+ How to handle data migration between tools requires meticulous planning. Most failed consolidations happen because teams underestimate data complexity. Migration best practices: Export all historical data before starting any cancellations Create backup systems for critical data Map data fields between old and new systems Test migration with subset of data first Maintain parallel systems during transition period Data migration priorities: Customer contact information and communication history Campaign performance data and analytics Content assets and creative materials Workflow automation rules and sequences Integration settings and API connections HubSpot's Free CRM Software Free CRM Software & Tools for Your Whole Team Sales Marketing Operations Customer Service Get free CRM Phase 6: Workflow Recreation and Optimization Time to complete: 2-3 weeks Expected savings: Eliminating manual processes worth 10-15 hours weekly per team member Don't just recreate old workflows, optimize them. Consolidation offers the opportunity to eliminate inefficiencies that existed because of tool limitations. Workflow optimization opportunities: Automatic data synchronization between marketing and sales Triggered campaigns based on comprehensive customer behavior Unified reporting eliminating manual data compilation Streamlined approval processes with fewer handoffs Phase 7: Team Training and Adoption Support Time to complete: 4 weeks ongoing Expected savings: Avoiding productivity loss worth $20,000+ in delayed adoption Discovering hidden features that reduce redundancy often happens during training. Most platforms have capabilities that eliminate the need for specialized tools, but teams never discover them without proper onboarding. Training strategy: Role-specific training rather than generic platform overviews Hands-on workshops with actual work scenarios Create internal documentation and quick-reference guides Establish “super users” for ongoing peer support Regular check-ins to address adoption challenges Phase 8: Integration Testing and Quality Assurance Time to complete: 1-2 weeks Expected savings: Preventing integration failures worth $15,000+ in lost productivity What's the migration sequence for minimal disruption? Run parallel systems for 2-4 weeks while testing all integrations and workflows. This ensures you can revert quickly if critical issues arise. Testing checklist: All data imports correctly and completely Automated workflows trigger properly Integrations with remaining tools function correctly User permissions and access controls work as intended Reporting and analytics provide accurate data Phase 9: Performance Monitoring and Optimization Time to complete: Ongoing monthly reviews Expected savings: Continuous optimization worth $5,000+ annually in improved efficiency What functionality might I actually lose? Most teams discover they lose 5-10% of highly specialized features but gain 40-60% improvement in overall efficiency and data accessibility. Performance metrics to track: Time spent on marketing operations tasks Campaign setup and launch speed Data accuracy and accessibility Team productivity and satisfaction Cost per marketing qualified lead Overall marketing ROI improvement Phase 10: Tool Retirement and Cost Reduction Time to complete: 1-2 weeks Expected savings: Immediate cost reduction of $30,000-100,000 annually Successful consolidation example: Pleo consolidated four external tools onto HubSpot, saving over $350,000 each year . Their success came from focusing on workflow simplification rather than feature maximization. Retirement strategy: Cancel subscriptions strategically to avoid early termination fees Download final data exports and archive properly Update billing and vendor relationships Communicate changes to all stakeholders Document lessons learned for future consolidation efforts What 95% Functionality Retention Actually Means [Example] When we say you can maintain 95% functionality, here's what that looks like in practice. Marketing Operations Before Consolidation 6 hours weekly managing tool integrations 12 different logins for team members 48-hour delay for cross-platform reporting $85,000 annual tool costs 15% data accuracy due to manual transfers Marketing Operations After Consolidation 30 minutes weekly system maintenance Single login with role-based access Real-time reporting and analytics $42,000 annual platform costs 95% data accuracy with automated workflows The 5% You Might Lose Highly specialized features used by one team member Very specific integrations with niche tools Advanced customization options rarely utilized Industry-specific templates or workflows The 40% Efficiency You Gain Unified customer data and complete interaction history Automated lead scoring and nurturing Streamlined campaign creation and deployment Consolidated reporting and analytics Simplified team training and onboarding Example Tool Consolidation Comparison Tables Feature Overlap Analysis: Before vs. After Consolidation Function Before (Multiple Tools) After (Unified Platform) Functionality Retained Email Marketing Mailchimp + ConvertKit HubSpot Marketing Hub 95% Social Media Buffer + Hootsuite + Sprout HubSpot + Native Integrations 90% CRM & Sales Salesforce + Pipedrive HubSpot CRM 95% Analytics Google Analytics + SEMrush HubSpot + GA4 Integration 85% Content Creation Canva + Adobe CC Canva + HubSpot Templates 90% Project Management Asana + Slack HubSpot Tasks + Slack 80% Total Annual Cost $84,000 $42,000 50% Savings Integration Complexity Reduction Current State (15+ Tools) Consolidated State (Unified Platform) 47 potential integration points 8 strategic integrations 12 hours monthly troubleshooting 2 hours monthly maintenance 15 separate user accounts Single SSO across all functions Manual data exports weekly Automated reporting daily 6 different support contacts Single vendor relationship Cost-Benefit Analysis: 3-Year Projection Example Year Current Tool Costs Consolidated Costs Annual Savings Efficiency Gains Year 1 $90,000 $45,000 $45,000 20 hours/week Year 2 $95,000 $47,000 $48,000 25 hours/week Year 3 $100,000 $49,000 $51,000 30 hours/week Total $285,000 $141,000 $144,000 1,950 hours Advanced Marketing Tool Consolidation Strategies: Beyond the Basics The 80/20 Approach to Tool Selection Focus consolidation efforts where you'll see the biggest impact. Typically, 80% of your marketing inefficiencies come from 20% of your tool sprawl. Target these high-impact areas first: Data integration points: Tools that require manual data transfer High-cost, low-usage: Expensive platforms with poor adoption Duplicate functionality: Multiple tools serving similar purposes Training bottlenecks: Complex tools that slow team onboarding Hybrid Consolidation: When Full Unification Isn't Optimal Some organizations benefit from partial consolidation — maintaining specialized tools for specific functions while unifying the core marketing operations stack. Keep separate when: Industry compliance requires specific tools Advanced technical capabilities aren't available in unified platforms Team expertise is so specialized that retraining costs exceed tool costs Integration costs exceed separate tool licensing Consolidate when: Tools serve overlapping functions Manual data transfer is required between systems Team members use less than 30% of a tool's capabilities Support and training costs are multiplying across vendors Maintaining Functionality During Transition The Parallel Operation Strategy Run old and new systems simultaneously for 30-60 days to ensure no critical functionality is lost. This approach costs more short term but prevents costly mistakes and can be done with the following five criteria. Feature Gap Mitigation When consolidation means losing specific features, develop workarounds before retiring old tools: Common Gap Solutions Advanced SEO features: Maintain SEMrush for technical audits, use unified platform for keyword tracking Complex design needs: Keep Adobe Creative Suite for major projects, use platform tools for routine graphics Specialized analytics: Maintain Google Analytics for deep-dive analysis, use platform for operational reporting Example ROI Calculation: Proving Consolidation Success Hard Cost Savings Immediate savings: Software licensing fees reduced by 40-60% Integration maintenance costs eliminated Vendor management overhead reduced Training costs decreased across fewer platforms Example calculation: Current annual tool costs: $84,000 Consolidated platform cost: $42,000 Implementation cost: $15,000 (one-time) Year 1 Net Savings: $27,000 3-Year ROI: 285% Soft Cost Benefits Productivity improvements: 15-25 hours weekly saved on tool management 50% faster campaign creation and deployment 80% reduction in data compilation time 90% improvement in reporting accuracy Strategic benefits: Better customer experience through unified data Faster decision-making with real-time analytics Improved team collaboration and knowledge sharing Enhanced scalability for future growth Common Marketing Tool Consolidation Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them Pitfall #1: Underestimating Data Complexity The problem: Teams assume data migration will be straightforward, then discover incompatible formats, missing fields, or broken relationships. The solution: Conduct thorough data audit before selecting new platform. Test migration with sample data sets. Budget 40% more time than initially estimated for data cleanup and mapping. Pitfall #2: Choosing a Platform Based on Features, Not Workflows The problem: Selecting a unified platform because it has the most features, without considering how your team actually works. The solution: Map current workflows first, then evaluate platforms based on workflow optimization potential, not feature checklists. Pitfall #3: Inadequate Change Management The problem: Only 25% of small and medium enterprises have clearly defined marketing performance measures, making it difficult to prove consolidation success and maintain team buy-in. The solution: Establish baseline metrics before consolidation begins. Create clear success criteria and communicate progress regularly to all stakeholders. Start your marketing tool consolidation action plan. Marketing tool consolidation isn‘t about using fewer tools for the sake of minimalism; it’s about creating a more efficient, effective marketing operation that delivers better results with less waste. Start by auditing your current tool spend and usage rates, focusing on workflows and data flow rather than feature comparisons. The best unified platform is the one that optimizes how your team actually works, not necessarily the one with the most features. Remember, you don‘t need to consolidate everything immediately; start with your highest-impact areas and expand systematically. When done strategically, consolidating from multiple apps to one unified platform doesn’t limit your capabilities — it unleashes them.

Boasting more than five million paid subscribers across the platform, Substack invites creators like myself to build an audience, make money, and connect with other readers and writers. My name is Alex Lewis, and I joined Substack in December 2022. My newsletter, Feels Like Home , is now home to more than 3,500 subscribers and receives over 20,000 monthly reads. I started the newsletter to explore some of my favorite things (like music, sports, and pop culture) and to have a creative outlet outside of my 10-year career in social media marketing. Here are the steps I took to grow my newsletter by 7,000% in less than three years and how it continues to help me avoid burnout and maintain my love for writing. Let’s get into it. How I Grew My Substack Newsletter by 7,000% 1. I wrote about what I enjoy. The beauty of Substack is you can write about whatever you want, and there’s a good chance you’ll find people who actually want to read it. When starting my Substack, I set out to write about things I love and the people and moments that have shaped me. This ensured that my writing would always be personal and always feel enjoyable because I’m writing about topics that I’m genuinely interested in, such as NBA basketball and healthy masculinity . Consistency is much more attainable when writing and publishing feel like less of a burden. I get excited to return to the page because I’m following my curiosities—and what I often find on the other side of this pursuit are people who love the same things and feel seen, as well as people who aren’t as familiar with the topic but gain a newfound appreciation for it. Ana Calin, whose How We Grow newsletter has hundreds of paid subscribers, encourages creators to “write the newsletter you would want to read—not the one you think will ‘perform.’” She adds, “Readers can tell when you’re being authentic, and they’ll stick around for your voice—not some polished version of what you think they want.” While Substack lets you label your newsletter under 1-2 categories to help readers find your publication, you don’t have to corner yourself into a specific niche in order to grow. Sharing your interests can pave the way for connection and consistency.

I nurtured the people who already supported me. Substack makes your writing accessible for people who want to read it. Before joining Substack, sharing my work on Instagram, LinkedIn, and X felt like the only way for people to learn that I published something new. Friends would tell me they missed something I wrote because the algorithm didn’t serve my posts to them. I chose to join Substack and start publishing a newsletter because I wanted the people who enjoyed reading my work to receive it directly in their inbox. While I still post about my publication on social media, email is my newsletter’s top traffic driver by far, generating 186% more views than the Substack app (which is my next closest). By inviting readers to opt into an easier way to read my work, I started my Substack journey with over 100 subscribers within the first week. That’s more than 100 people who could share my newsletter and invite others to subscribe and begin sharing. If you already have an audience but are having trouble reaching them online, consider starting a newsletter. As noted by Seth Werkheiser, who writes his Social Media Escape Club newsletter to more than 6,000 subscribers, “Direct access to your audience is so important, and very much worth the time and energy.” Social media algorithms are unreliable. Through Substack, you can take ownership of your email list and speak directly to your audience while making it easier for your long-time supporters to continue supporting. 3. I focused on consistent quality over consistent quantity. Just because your favorite Substack writer posts every day doesn’t mean you need to. What I began to observe, prior to joining Substack, is that I averaged two new essays per month. These weren’t just throwaway ideas; they were well-researched, thoughtful, long-form pieces that came as a result of reading, living, listening, and wrestling. Once I started my newsletter, I launched a content recommendation series, Take It or Leave It , to fill in the gaps between essays. These started as weekly drops, but I shifted the cadence to monthly at the beginning of this year as I learned how challenging it was to maintain a weekly rhythm—especially since writing isn’t my full-time job. Also, I knew my biggest metric for success was making work I’m proud of, and that takes time. Work I’m proud of is work I’m comfortable with returning to and want to share even after its publish date. This is work I believe readers can come to at any point and still find value in. Consistency, in terms of how much you post, is often discussed as being tied to growth. But Sarah Fay, whose Substack Writers at Work newsletter has over 36,000 subscribers, says , “Substack’s algorithm doesn’t favor frequency.” Fay adds, “Engagement is what matters.” Posting more may get your newsletter in front of people more often, but it can also make your work harder to keep up with or even bombard readers’ already jam-packed inboxes. By focusing on consistent quality over upping your quantity, you can do a better job of delivering work your readers won’t want to miss because they know you always bring your best. 4. I “stole” from my favorite writers. Your fellow Substack writers are the best blueprint for getting started. I began my Substack journey on a whim. After months of putting off starting a newsletter, I finally decided to jump all in. Not knowing where to begin, I looked at publications from Substack writers I already followed, such as Hunter Harris and Emily Sundberg . By looking at their newsletters, I gained a better understanding of how I wanted to structure my About page, as well as what to include in the header and footer of my emails. While I made the words my own, they helped me learn what’s possible with my publication. Austin Kleon, whose self-titled Substack has 297,000 subscribers, authored the book, Steal Like An Artist . Within the guide, Kleon quotes fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto: “Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy you will find your self.” Your best path forward isn’t plagiarism; it’s learning from the writers and creators you admire. It’s letting the best of what they do inspire you to make the best work you can. A few of my favorite Substackers are: Shivani Kumar Marc Typo Rachel Moss Jamal Robinson Dia Lupo Katie Heindl 5. I embraced playfulness and experimentation. There’s no one way to show up on Substack. Since starting my newsletter, I’ve tried different types of posts outside of long-form essays and content recommendations. I’ve interviewed artists I admire, such as Louisville rapper Horace Gaither and senior social media manager Jenn Crim . I’ve written love letters with my best friends and collaborated on conversation series with other writers. For the sake of self-care and creative freedom, I resist rules and restrictions when it comes to Substack. I treat my newsletter as a playground instead of a prison. I set the guidelines for my creativity. And just like my own little playground, I can pick and choose what I want to play with, as well as how long I want to play with it. Robert Monson, whose Musings From A Broken Heart newsletter has more than 7,000 subscribers, gives himself “permission to play and not appear perfect on Substack.” Supporters of his work, including myself, resonate with Robert’s openness and tag along for the ride wherever he chooses to go. Try stuff. Follow your curiosities and see where they might take you. Mike Sowden of the Everything is Amazing newsletter said his first year on Substack was “just experimenting with everything.” He also noted, “I just didn’t want to write stuff that didn’t fill me with joy, curiosity, and wonder.” Sowden now has over 31,000 subscribers. Even if your playfulness doesn’t lead to audience growth, it might lead to more joy—and that’s just as important. 6. I shared about my Substack off of Substack. There’s a whole world outside of Substack that doesn’t know about your newsletter. Before joining Substack, I wrote an essay about rapper Kid Cudi, which I’ve since re-published on my newsletter. Not thinking anything of it, I shared the essay on Twitter (now X) and tagged Cudi. Less than 10 minutes later, he retweeted the essay and introduced my writing to his millions of followers. I carried that strategy over to Substack and now regularly promote my newsletter on social media. Some of my most popular pieces gained traction on platforms like X, Threads, and LinkedIn, which drove more traffic to my newsletter. Andy Adams, who publishes FlakPhoto Digest to over 38,000 Substack subscribers, noted , “Instagram plays a significant role in my Substack workflow.” He added, “[Instagram] has been instrumental in growing the audience for my Substack newsletter. For me, they go hand in hand.” You’re already on social media. Use it to get your Substack in front of more people. In some ways, it can even be an extension of your newsletter by inviting new readers to dive deeper into your work. 7. I benefited from Substacks’s features. Substack is jam-packed with tools to help you grow your newsletter audience. The Substack Network, including app features like Notes and Chat , has driven 86% of my newsletter subscribers. Because culture journalist Ayan Artan recommended my Substack using the platform’s Recommendation feature, I gained nearly 1,000 subscribers in one month at the start of this year. I regularly connect with other writers and readers on Notes, which is similar to short-form content channels like X and Threads. Notes has also introduced me to new Substacks and kept me inspired. I’m a better artist and person because of the relationships I’ve been able to build on Substack. Mario Gabriele of The Generalist says, “Substack isn’t just a place to publish or read – it’s an ecosystem for writers and creators to collaborate and contribute to one another’s growth.” You don’t have to go elsewhere to grow. Your new readers are waiting for you on Substack. 8. I stuck with it. Substack growth could happen overnight, but it’s more likely to take time. I’ve been on Substack for more than two and a half years, and it took over a year for me to reach my first 1,000 newsletter subscribers. Six months later, I gained nearly 1,000 subscribers in one month. While each month looks different, my greatest achievement is that I’ve kept returning to the page. Writing has been a source of joy for me, and I’m thankful that I get to nurture that love through my newsletter. Mika, who publishes the musings by mika newsletter, wrote about plateauing on Substack . “My secret sauce on Substack is enjoying the journey rather than fixating solely on the destination,” she shared. Continuing on this topic, Mika wrote, “Showing up and honoring what you’re feeling called to write, embracing your authenticity, sparking real connections, and unleashing creativity is the real magic of Substack!” Sometimes, the best thing for your growth may be setting the numbers aside and remembering what brought you to Substack in the first place. That will keep you going even if growth slows down.

    "essence": "Home Marketing Condé Nast marketing leader shares her framework for destroying your imposter syndrome Condé Nast marketing leader shares her framework for destroying your imposter syndrome Written by: Laura M. Browning Updated: 07/31/25 When I spoke to this week��s master in marketing, I was surprised at how seamlessly she had combined her two professional loves, digital marketing and life coaching. I’ll admit to having been skeptical about life coaching in the past, but this conversation changed my mind. As a life coach, she developed a framework she calls the Three See’s — more on that below — that can help any marketer up their game. Meet the Master Sheena Hakimian Senior director of digital consumer marketing at Condé Nast and certified life coach Fun fact: Sheena’s journey to becoming a life coach began at her favorite NYC restaurant, Piccola Cucina, which led her to taking an eight-month certification course. “The best decision I ever made,” she says. Lesson 1: Focus on what you can control. “There’s just so much change,” Hakimian says, in what I would consider a gross understatement at the moment. “From the [shift in traffic patterns] to us not knowing exactly how AI is going to shape our jobs to things going on in the world.” If you focus on all of that at once, it becomes clutter. (See: my brain.) And all these uncertainties just breed more anxiety. But “how do you build resilience to uncertainty?” Hakimian asks. “It’s by focusing on the things you can control.” As a marketer, this might look like what your data is telling you, understanding your customer needs, or growing your email lists. Condé Nast has a very diverse set of brands — Pitchfork, The New Yorker , and Vanity Fair are just a few — so Hakimian really took the time this year to “slice and dice. Really understanding different segments of your website and how they respond to different parts of your funnel.” “We know we can’t have a one-size-fits-all strategy on our website anymore,” she says. So about that slicing and dicing: She did A/B testing within just the politics section of Vanity Fair . And she found that allowing readers one free article before gating the content — i.e., requiring a subscription — led to a 20% increase in subscriptions in their test panels. Hakimian and her team have taken a lot of time over the last six months to do this testing thoughtfully — because what you do with the data is something that you can control. Lesson 2: Make your boss’ life easier. “What [is my boss] talking about that might not be on the KPI sheet?” Hakimian asks. It’s not a rhetorical question: You can’t solve business problems if you don’t know what they are. “The mindset is, I’m here to make my boss’ life easier.” That doesn’t mean Hakimian doesn’t care about herself — “it just means that I’m aligning [with] the people who are responsible for my career. ” She’s spent much of this year working on being a good communicator, even sharing her communication goal with her team and asking them to hold her accountable. And that means being a good listener. Wanna make an impact? “Actively listening — when you really listen,” Hakimian says, you’ll be able to ask better questions and find more clarity. Whether it’s a 1:1, a Zoom meeting, or even a company all-hands, Hakimian keeps her ears open for problems, complaints, or other bugbears. “And then I can just shift my mindset — and solve for that.” Lesson 3: Build a strong in-person brand. As both a life coach and a digital marketer, Hakimian sees her own personal growth — particularly unlocking her self-confidence — as essential to her marketing career. “A great tangible way to actively pursue building more self-confidence — and ultimately self-worth — is by building a strong in-person brand ,” she tells me. It’s not that your digital presence is less important — “we have to take control of how we’re perceived online,” she says — but Hakimian is “on a mission to remind people that how you’re perceived [in person] is important. Really important.” So important, in fact, that Hakimian built a framework she calls the Three See’s: How you see yourself, how others see you, and how you see your future. She uses this proprietary framework in her life-coaching business to help other people build a strong, aligned personal brand. But like any good marketer, Hakimian tested it out first — on herself. “Getting super self-aware and honest with myself has released a lot of that imposter syndrome so that I could go in and take risks” in her job as a marketing leader at Condé Nast. And that, she says, will make you stand out.

If so, has it been a net positive or net negative? In many ways, the proliferation of AI content is making creating quality content, especially educational content, more difficult so I'm always curious how this new technology is affecting other fields? — Max Miller , Founder and host, Tasting History This Week’s Answer Hakimian says: From a marketing and subscription standpoint, we’re excited to explore how AI can help us deliver more dynamic, personalized experiences on our sites. That said, the human touch is still the heart of our strategy, especially when it comes to brand voice and creative direction. The rise of AI-generated content has actually made high-quality, thoughtful content even more valuable. It’s easier than ever to pump out content, but much harder to build trust, credibility, and originality. At Condé Nast, our unique edge is still our storytelling and editorial integrity. AI, to us, is a tool to scale our voices around that, not replace it. So overall, I’d say it can be a net positive when used with intention. But like anything, it depends on how thoughtfully it’s integrated. Next Week’s Lingering Question Hakimian asks: [Our next master in marketing has] built an incredible reputation for understanding Gen Z behavior and creating authentic, community-first content. In a world that’s constantly chasing virality, how do you balance consistency with creativity, and what advice would you give to brands trying to build genuine relationships over time, not just reach?
