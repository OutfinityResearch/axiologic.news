    "essence": "Perplexity’s Discover Pages Offer A Surprising SEO Insight Perplexity's Discover pages are praised as an example of programmatic SEO. In fact, they’re something more ambitious in scope. SEJ STAFF Roger Montti 11 seconds ago ⋅ 5 min read SEJ STAFF Roger Montti Owner - Martinibuster.com at Martinibuster.com Bio Follow { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> A post on LinkedIn called attention to Perplexity&rsquo;s content discovery feed called Discover, which generates content on trending news topics. It praised the feed as a positive example of programmatic SEO, although some said that its days in Google&rsquo;s search results are numbered. Everyone in that discussion believes those pages are one thing. In fact, they are something else entirely. Context: Perplexity Discover Perplexity publishes a Discover feed of trending topics. The page is like a portal to the news of the day, featuring short summaries and links to web pages containing the full summary plus links to the original news reporting. SEOs have noticed that some of those pages are ranking in Google Search, spurring a viral discussion on LinkedIn. Perplexity Discover And Programmatic SEO Programmatic SEO is the use of automation to optimize web content and could also apply to scaled content creation. It can be tricky to pull off well and can result in a poor outcome if not. A LinkedIn post calling attention to the Perplexity AI-generated Discover feed cited it as an example of programmatic SEO &ldquo;on steroids.&rdquo; They wrote: &ldquo;For every trending news topic, it automatically creates a public webpage. These pages are now showing up in Google Search results. When clicked, users land on a summary + can ask follow-up questions in the chatbot. ...This is such a good Programmatic SEO tactic put on steroids!&rdquo; One of the comments in that discussion hailed the Perplexity pages as an example of good programmatic SEO: &ldquo;This is a very bold move by Perplexity. Programmatic SEO at scale, backed by trending topics, is a smart way to capture attention and traffic. The key challenge will be sustainability – Google may see this as thin content or adjust algorithms against it. Still, it shows how AI + SEO is evolving faster than expected.&rdquo; Another person agreed: &ldquo;SEO has been part of their growth strategy since last year, and it works for them quite well&rdquo; The rest of the comments praised Perplexity&rsquo;s SEO as &ldquo;bold&rdquo; and &ldquo;clever&rdquo; as well as providing &ldquo;genuine user value.&rdquo; But there were also some that predicted that &ldquo;Google won&rsquo;t allow this trend...&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Google will nerf it in a few weeks...&rdquo; The overall sentiment of Perplexity&rsquo;s implementation of programmatic SEO was positive. Except that there is no SEO. Perplexity Discover Is Not Programmatic SEO Contrary to what was said in the LinkedIn discussion, Perplexity is not engaging in &ldquo;programmatic SEO,&rdquo; nor are they trying to rank in Google. A peek at the source code of any of the Discover pages shows that the title elements and the meta descriptions are not optimized to rank in search engines. Screenshot Of A Perplexity Discover Web Page Every single page created by Perplexity appears to have the exact same title and meta description elements: <title>Perplexity</title> <meta name=&rdquo;description&rdquo; content=&rdquo;Perplexity is a free AI-powered answer engine that provides accurate, trusted, and real-time answers to any question.&rdquo;/> Every page contains the same canonical tag: <link rel=&rdquo;canonical&rdquo; href=&rdquo; https://www.perplexity.ai &rdquo; /> It&rsquo;s clear that Perplexity&rsquo;s Discover pages are not optimized for Google Search and that the pages are not created for search engines. The pages are created for humans. Given how the Discover pages are not optimized, it&rsquo;s not a surprise that: Every page I tested failed to rank in Google Search. It&rsquo;s clear that Perplexity is engaged in programmatic SEO. Perplexity&rsquo;s Discover pages are not created to rank in Google Search. Perplexity&rsquo;s Discover pages are created specifically for humans. If any pages rank in Google, that&rsquo;s entirely an accident and not by design. What Is Perplexity Actually Doing? Perplexity&rsquo;s Discover pages are examples of something bigger than SEO. They are web pages created for the benefit of users. The fact that no SEO is applied shows that Perplexity is focused on making the Discover pages destinations that users turn to in order to keep in touch with the events of the day. Perplexity Discover is a user-first web destination created with zero SEO, likely because the goals are more ambitious than depending on Google for traffic. The Surprising SEO Insight? It may well be that a good starting point for creating a website and forming a strategy for promoting it lies outside the SEO sandbox. In my experience, I&rsquo;ve had success creating and promoting outside the standard SEO framework, because SEO strategies are inherently limited: they have one goal, ranking, and miss out on activities that create popularity. SEO limits how you can promote a site with arbitrary rules such as: Don&rsquo;t obtain links from sites that nofollow their links. Don&rsquo;t get links from sites that have low popularity. Offline promotion doesn&rsquo;t help your site rank. And here&rsquo;s the thing: promoting a site with strategies focused on building brand name recognition with an audience tends to create the kinds of user behavior signals that we know Google is looking for.

Members Online • Academic-Squash2738 Been A/B testing forms through ad splits - wondering if there's a better workflow? Question Currently running form A/B tests by creating separate ad campaigns (50% traffic to Form A, 50% to Form B) and comparing conversion rates manually. It's working okay, but the process feels clunky, and I am wondering if I am missing something: My current workflow: Create two form versions Set up duplicate ad campaigns with different form links Wait a few weeks, manually pull conversion data from both Try to eyeball if the difference is significant enough to matter Pain points I'm hitting: Traffic never splits exactly 50/50 (one campaign always gets more) Hard to tell when I have enough data to make decisions Takes forever to set up tests for small changes Can only realistically test one thing at a time What I'm curious about: Are there tools that handle the traffic splitting automatically? How do you deal with statistical significance? Just gut feeling? Anyone testing multiple form variations simultaneously? Better ways to track beyond just \"Form A got X%, Form B got Y%\"? I think I am doing this the hard way, and there is probably a more efficient approach I am missing. Would love to hear how others handle this workflow! Read more Share",

Members Online • infofilms lost after burn out, now thinking of a spec brand ad I used to work as a videographer/editor and sometimes as a cam assistant on bigger shoots. This year I hit a wall and what used to inspire me doesn't anymore, and I feel kinda lost, I dont even want to crash out I want to create again, but not just more noise that gets scrolled past. I'm thinking of making a spec brand ad to push myself and to tell better stories that really moves, I read this earlier \"good work informs, great work transforms\" My background is more technical camera + editing but I’ve always struggled with the brand/ideation side. I used to just shoot what was asked, never really thought about how to come up with strong concepts. I want to make something that sticks, and maybe use it as a step to get hired again. I would mainly work on this spec ad using stocks, GenAI, narration, sound design. On a creative ideation stand point, I am still need some learning to do, but I dont want to get stuck on that alone, I want to execute as I go, I am currently in a beginners paralysis. My goal is to get hired even in small projects as a beginner. For the creative people here, do you have any insights on how I can make this work out? Any input, mindset, tips are appreciated.

I’ve got a small app for my product, but it's hard to keep up with competitors trend shifts. What I’d really like is a way to keep an eye on the bigger moves they make. For example, I don’t care if they just put up a new page, but if that page gets picked up by search engines and suddenly starts pulling in a lot of visitors, that’s the kind of thing I’d want to know about so I can follow that trend too. How do you usually approach this? Read more Share",

Question I run marketing in house for a B2B company and our quarters used to yo-yo because campaigns hit hard for a week then quality slid and nobody could explain why. We were chasing channel wins and forgetting the handoff, so sales blamed leads and I blamed timing, then everyone lost confidence since the story kept changing. I rebuilt the basics because I think steady beats shiny. We tied every form and call to the CRM, then we met once a week with one simple scorecard that followed a line from search to meeting and then to revenue. Content moved in step with paid so a topic did not live in ads without a page that could carry it. A colleague pointed me to EWR Digital who talk a lot about growth systems and that nudge helped me join SEO with paid and light automation on the same page rather than three. We still test since curiosity matters, yet we run tests inside one product line first and we keep the scorecard unchanged so we can trust the signal. That rhythm calmed the room because people see the same few numbers and the calendar stops lurching. If you had to pick one habit that cut pipeline whiplash at your company what would you lock in and defend when the quarter gets loud? Read more Share",

    "essence": "Adspeak Criteo vs. the Upstarts: A Retail Media Showdown The retail media gold rush is getting crowded, and Criteo’s position is being tested ADWEEK By Ryan Joe --> Retail (or commerce) media has been one of the most promising growth areas in digital advertising over the last few years. But you can’t have gold without a rush—and in this case, its a rush of retailers trying to become ad networks, and a rush of vendors with all the tools to help them power up. If there’s one adtech company that’s long been associated with retail, it’s Criteo. It got its start as a retargeting firm, and benefited from the retail media boom. But lately a bunch of upstarts have emerged, claiming to offer better tech at cheaper prices. Criteo has also suffered attrition, as clients like Uber Eats and Target’s Roundel have rolled back their relationship with the public company. But Criteo has held steady so far despite these headwinds. In this episode of Adspeak, retail and commerce editor Kathryn Lundstrom looks at how Criteo has managed to hold up amidst a sea of upstart competition—for now. With many RFPs still undecided, September will be a major moment for the company. And of course, Criteo continues to fight a two-front war. Besides a handful of new companies nipping at its heels, it still has to contend with Amazon, the ecommerce giant that’s also releasing new products that seem to take aim at one of Criteo’s core value props: helping companies build their own retail media networks.

    "essence": "Branding Meet the Brands Partnering With The Summer I Turned Pretty to Reach Gen Z Sour Patch Kids and Catbird are collaborating with the show Brands are backing Amazon Prime's The Summer I Turned Pretty. Amazon By Elena Cavender --> Amazon Prime Video’s The Summer I Turned Pretty’s final season is well underway, and brands are eager to reach the show’s fans. The third season of the show debuted on July 16 with two episodes, receiving 25 million viewers globally in the first week, according to Amazon . That’s a 40% increase in viewership compared to the second season’s performance in the same time period. Additionally, the show’s viewership tripled from Season 1 to Season 3 in the first seven days. As the show’s popularity has grown as the series comes to an end, Amazon snagged deals with brands including Catbird jewelry, apparel brand Solid & Striped, and Sour Patch Kids that go beyond product placement. ADWEEK rounded up the brands featured in the third season of The Summer I Turned Pretty. Catbird Jewelry brand Catbird scored an integration into one of the most talked about moments of the show: Jeremiah’s proposal to Belly in the second episode. Jeremiah proposes with Catbird’s dainty Diamond Fizz Ring, which generated lots of online chatter about its slight size. Leigh Plessner, Catbird’s chief creative officer, told ADWEEK that the brand knew that the ring was going to be used in the show, but seeing how it was used and received by audiences was a fun moment. Within a month of the episode airing, Catbird saw a 1,900% increase in pageviews for the ring on the brand’s ecommerce site, according to Catbird. Belly also wears Catbird’s 100 Summers Gold Chain with a daisy charm in the show. The partnership between Catbird and The Summer I Turned Pretty came about after Opening Ceremony cofounder and the show’s stylist Carol Lim DMed Plessner’s personal Instagram account. They then created a seven-piece jewelry collection that’s available on Catbird’s website. It includes a gold bracelet that reads Belly as well as a shell charm. Catbird has collaborated with Phoebe Bridgers, Laufey, Jenny Slate, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the past. The goal is for partnerships to come from a place of real connection to the collaborative project, said Plessner. For The Summer I Turned Pretty, Plessner felt that jewelry was a big part of the show’s story and of Belly’s style evolution. “Something that’s really special about the show is that even though the main characters are of a certain age, the fan base is across generation and gender,” said Plessner. “While the theory of reaching young people is true, there’s so much more to it.” Sour Patch Kids Still, the show heavily skews towards Gen Z and teens—a core demographic that Sour Patch Kids uses to vet its partnerships, said John Vasington, senior brand manager of candy at Mondelez International. “To have a show that’s so popular amongst that audience—and so naturally integrates our brands in a way that feels really resonant—had us very excited to make things official and become official partners for season three,” said Vasington. Sour Patch Kids and Swedish Fish—both owned by Mondelez International—were organically included in the second season of the show when Conrad buys Belly Sour Patch Kids while Jeremiah buys her Swedish Fish. “Each brother and their storyline up to that point in Season 2 really aligned with the brands and the storytelling there,” said Vasington. He pointed to Jeremiah’s sweetness fitting with Swedish Fish. Conrad is more reserved before opening up embodying the sour then sweet taste of Sour Patch Kids. For Season 3, Mondelez released exclusive Team Conrad and Team Jeremiah packs of Sour Patch Kids and Swedish Fish and watch party snack mixes. Ten thousand of the Team Conrad and Team Jeremiah packs were made to sell on Amazon. The packs are also for sale on teen-centric retailer IT’SUGAR. A handful of retailers including Krogers and Albertsons also received in-store displays featuring the Conrad and Jeremiah characters. Solid & Striped Solid & Striped’s integration into the third season of the show came from being organically part of the first season of the show when Belly wears two of the brand’s swimsuits. For Season 3, the apparel brand built a capsule collection with Lim. It’s the first time that Solid & Striped has done a brand integration and it felt like a natural fit for the brand, Ginger Lau, Solid & Striped’s design director, told ADWEEK. “We chose to do it because Belly already wore Solid & Striped before we formalized the partnership,” said Lau. “We made sure that the pieces weren’t just placed, but felt like part of the storytelling.” Solid & Striped’s products are available on the brand’s ecommerce site and on Amazon. On social media, Solid & Striped noticed a surge in engagement about the show, especially among younger audiences, said Michelle Guiles, the brand’s COO. The collaboration drove 2.5 times higher engagement than the brand’s average social posts with notable increases in reach and follower count. Coach Coach is also featured in the show, and is running traditional ads during breaks on the ad-supported tier of Prime Video. The fashion brand also created a capsule line of bags inspired by the show. The collection of 21 pieces includes bag charms, a backpack, and quilted purses. Coach sold the products on its own ecommerce site as well as Amazon—although the collection is currently sold out on Amazon. “It felt like a natural fit for Coach and Coachtopia because of the way the show’s themes of youth, transformation and self-discovery align with our brand values,” said Jennifer Yue, svp of strategy and consumer insights at Tapestry and Coach. “Our integration into the show has allowed us to be part of the story and create a cultural moment that resonates with Gen Z.” Elena Cavender Elena Cavender is ADWEEK's influencer marketing reporter based out of New York City.

    "essence": "Brands Blue Apron Pioneered Meal-Kit Subscriptions. Here's Why It's Scrapping Them Three dystopian spots mark the end of Blue Apron’s subscription era Blue Apron helped introduce America to meal kits in 2012, but today's it's playing in a crowded category. Blue Apron By Robert Klara --> Earlier this year, The Hollywood Reporter asked Charlie Brooker, creator of Netflix’s anthology series Black Mirror , how he can take almost any topic to a dark and dystopian place. Brooker admitted to having “a lot of neuroses and worrying about horrible but logical consequences. I can’t look at anything without thinking, ‘How could that hurt me?’” he said. Thus far, the long-running series hasn’t taken on the topic of home meal kits—but maybe it should. Next week, Blue Apron will begin airing three spots that head of marketing Raina Enand is first to say are distinctively Black Mirror-like. “Hopefully when you watch it,” she said, “it should look like something that you would not expect from Blue Apron.” And you probably wouldn’t. That’s because the characters in these spots are trapped in a nightmare realm controlled by nefarious subscription plans—which have been Blue Apron’s revenue model since its 2012 founding. But now that model is gone, replaced by à la carte ordering. The three ads—the final piece of a comprehensive brand overhaul—follow a similar story line. They open with people trapped in a gray, Orwellian world where it’s impossible to do anything from unfasten a seatbelt to get a beverage from a vending machine without committing to prepayment. “We turned subscription fatigue into a dystopian fever dream,” said Angela Campos, creative and commercial director of Quirk, the agency behind the work. “Trust me, it’s a lot more fun to watch than to live through.” These slate gray visions give way to a happier, freer world where purchase flexibility and consumer autonomy have returned. “Somewhere along the way, you had to subscribe to everything—even dinner,” intones a narrator in one spot. “With the new Blue Apron, you don’t.” The video segments alone are an ambitious effort: three 30-second ads with six 15-second cuts; a 15-second homepage app video; a 16-minute video; 10 videos for social media; and seven audio versions. But one question looms behind all of it: why is Blue Apron scuttling its revenue model in the first place? From meal kits to á la carte Because times change. England said that the fast-paced life that made meal subscriptions look like a good solution a decade ago has now grown so hectic that subscriptions feel confining and out of date. “Life is really different now,” she said. “Busy families need more control and flexibility.” Committing to a weekly meal plan, she added, is “just not how people eat food.” To increase flexibility, Blue Apron has doubled its menu offerings to 100 and added two new kinds of kits. Assemble & Bake is aimed at families and can be prepared in 10 minutes, while Dish is a single-serve meal that comes ready to put into the oven. Those who still prefer the subscription option will enjoy rewards such as Blue Apron+, which offers perks like free delivery and Auto Ship and Save, which lets customers dial their delivery frequency anywhere from weekly to just one week a month. The other reason Blue Apron is changing its business model is more systemic: the company has needed a major overhaul for years. Wonder Group bought Blue Apron in 2023 for $103 million, a shadow of the $1.9 billion valuation Wall Street gave it after its 2017 IPO. But operational complexities, high marketing costs, and increased competition caused the brand to slip from those heights almost immediately. By the end of 2017, Blue Apron’s net losses tallied to $210 million, while its customer count shrank by 15%. In fact, high customer attrition rates assail the whole meal-kit industry , a love-’em-and-leave-’em world in which customers pivot among introductory offers instead of staying loyal to one service. Research conducted by the Wall Street Journal in 2023 showed that a staggering 90% of customers for the five leading meal-kit brands abandoned their memberships within a year of signing up. A hill to climb As part of the brand relaunch, Blue Apron has also reworked its website, toning down the blues in favor of ochre and flax “to make the food the star of the show,” Enand said. Food photography has also changed to “look like a plate on a countertop in your home—it should feel identifiable with your life.” Yet even if all the new tweaks resonate with customers, category leader Hello Fresh still commands some 75% of the market—leaving open the question of whether these efforts, calculated as they are, will deliver the needed results. Digital transformation authority Craig Miller, author of Bricks and Clicks: How We Drove Sonic into the Digital Age, believes the revenue model shift will help Blue Apron reclaim some market share, “but would most likely be a short-term win and difficult to sustain.” “The tradeoffs and drawbacks for a no-commitment model may more than offset the benefits,” Miller continued. “An increase in operational complexity in their supply chain will continue to put a strain on their customer service levels and overall profitability.” Meal Kits Had Their Chance. Covid-19 Has Given Them Another One But Enand remains confident that the hard work will pay off. “We’ve been working on this for the past year, listening to customer feedback on what the market is moving towards, and we really thought about this as all encompassing from every aspect of the business,” she said. “Calling it a rebrand is actually doing it a disservice. It’s really a relaunch of the company.” Robert Klara Robert Klara is the senior editor of brands at Adweek, specializing in the evolution and impact of brands. @UpperEastRob | robert.klara@adweek.com Recommended videos The Latest Newsletters ADWEEK Daily Start your morning right with a round-up of first-look news and sharp analysis you won't find elsewhere.

    "essence": "Programming & Performance How the Marketing Campaign for Neon's Body Horror Hit Came 'Together' The campaign featured appearances from the cast, special screenings, and pop-up shops Dave Franco and Alison Brie with fans at the Together pop-up in LA. Neon By Saleah Blancaflor --> If you have access to the internet, chances are you’ve seen Alison Brie and Dave Franco on your social feed at some point over the last few months, and that’s all due to Together’s body of work. Neon’s new body horror film, Together, premiered at the end of July and has amassed nearly $28 million at the global box office (on a budget of $17 million), debuting to $10.9 million domestically . Before that, it made its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and screened at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas, in March, receiving critical praise. Directed by Michael Shanks, the film stars Brie and Franco as a couple in a long-term relationship who move to the suburbs when strange occurrences begin to happen that fuse them together. And to promote the film, the indie distributor ran an extensive—and absurd—marketing campaign, featuring a mix of digital and real-life stunts. Part of the campaign’s success stemmed from the stars’ complete buy-in, with Brie and Franco, who are married, working in tandem with the marketing team and Shanks on the rollout. “We must have thrown 40 ideas at them and they said yes to probably 38,” Christian Parkes, chief marketing officer at Neon, said. “Within that, we got a tighter group of the things that we felt would resonate most in the campaign. While we’re pitching them ideas, they’re building on those ideas. It’s rare that it works in a way that Together did, but this was truly collaborative with Shanks, Dave, and Alison.” Among the highlights, the Neon social accounts leaned into showcasing celebrity couples and sharing images of fans taking pictures in front of a billboard featuring Brie and Franco. Meanwhile, the pair put in the legwork, attending various events, screenings, and pop-up shops. Some of the specific moments include Brie and Franco attending a New York Yankees game together, where they put on a double-headed hoodie and threw out the first pitch at the start of the game. Other moments came from the couple going on “paparazzi walks” that captured them in bizarre “codependent and vulnerable moments,” with Brie clipping Franco’s toenails in Chicago’s Griffith Park or Franco drinking a towel soaked with Brie’s sweat after a workout. “Dave and Alison just jumped in. They were all in and couldn’t have been better to work with,” Parkes said. “What that does is it just inspires you to push harder and to do better work because they’re giving you the permission.” How These 7 Horror Films Pushed the Boundaries of Movie Marketing Brie and Franco weren’t the only ones going above and beyond, as Neon brought in new technology, hosting a “pupil dilation screening” in Los Angeles to examine people’s eyes while they watched the movie. The tech came from a Singapore-based company, and the screening was the first time it was tested live, according to Parkes. Neon also flew in the team from Singapore and cameras from Germany to make the stunt happen. “It was terrifying for us because it was a huge effort to pull it all together and to make it work—and obviously a great expense,” Parkes said. “It was almost like live TV. We didn’t know if this thing would actually work, but obviously it did because those pupils were just exploding.” Some of the other themed screenings included a partnership with OurRitual , as well as a “buy one, get one free” ticket promotion. “These things are informed by the film and taking the theme as a root of inspiration: bringing people together,” Parkes said. “If couples are apart, and it’s because of us, we’ll bring them back together. As messed up as Together is, it’s ultimately a love story. We could all have a little bit of that right now.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by NEON (@neonrated) How to sell a pop-up shop Another part of the campaign featured pop-up shops with exclusive merch and Brie and Franco in attendance. According to Parkes, thousands of fans showed up waiting in line for hours. The limited-edition merch included a body saw, hair floss, the joint hoodie Brie and Franco wore to the Yankees game, a sculpted finger bowl, and conventional items such as vinyl records and t-shirts. There were also things like rat king-shaped air fresheners that Parkes said were intentionally made to smell bad. “The exciting stuff lives on the fringes,” Parkes said. “It lives on the edges. It doesn’t live in the middle. The middle is inherently boring for us. We like to live on the outside a little bit. That’s where things get more interesting, and, ultimately, that’s what audiences want.” Saleah Blancaflor Saleah Blancaflor is a TV reporter at ADWEEK. @saleyley | saleah.blancaflor@adweek.com Recommended videos The Latest Newsletters ADWEEK Daily Start your morning right with a round-up of first-look news and sharp analysis you won't find elsewhere.

    "essence": "Creativity x Culture At Bad Bunny's Sold-Out Puerto Rico Residency, Brands Score a Front-Row Seat Ritz Crackers, Method, and more are courting Latino fans through experiences in and around the event ADWEEK; Mike Coppola/Getty Images By Cydney Lee --> Bad Bunny has been booked and busy in 2025. From releasing his sixth album , hosting Saturday Night Live , announcing a world tour , and starring in Ritz’s first Super Bowl commercial , the Puerto Rican artist has been everywhere. However, a milestone of his year (and career) has been No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí (I Don’t Want to Leave From Here), his first-of-its-kind, sold-out homecoming residency running every weekend from July 11 to September 14 at Coliseo de Puerto Rico. While tickets for the first nine shows were reserved exclusively for island residents, Discover Puerto Rico —the island’s official tourism guide—partnered with Live Nation-owned travel platform Vibee to sell curated vacation packages for the residency, which are expected to generate nearly $200 million in economic impact. “That’s extremely conservative because that’s only taking into consideration those packages,” Glorianna Yamin, Discover Puerto Rico’s vp of marketing, told ADWEEK. He said the board expects to have an all-encompassing figure, including visitors who stayed at external hotels and rentals, once the residency concludes. “[Vibee] sold 48,000 room nights [across] 34 properties,” she continued. “Not only the metro region where the concert is taking place, but around the entire island.” In addition to Discover Puerto Rico, which has leveraged the summer event by marketing other hotspots around the island, brands including Ritz Crackers, Method, Vibee, Wendy’s , and JetBlue are all capitalizing on the influx of concertgoers through fan giveaways and on-site experiences. Adidas Originals also released a sneaker in collaboration with the musician, who has served as one of its brand ambassadors since 2021. No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí has delivered organic boosts for brands like Tinder, which has seen a 35% increase in swipe activity in Puerto Rico and a nearly 52% increase in Passport Mode activity (a feature that allows users to change their location) to San Juan, P.R., since July. An homage to Puerto Rico For Miguel Lopez-Ixta, head of brand and growth at creative agency Need Pastel, which previously collaborated with the musician on merch designs for Bad Bunny’s past tours, the musician’s residency underscores the significance of Latin-American buying power. According to the 2025 U.S. Latino GDP Report , the total economic output of Latinos in the U.S. reached a record $4.1 trillion in 2023, up from $3.7 trillion in 2022. “At the end of the day, the whole residency was for Puerto Rico,” he said. “There’s a ton of local businesses, and that was the goal: to make sure they benefit. So if you’re a brand, you have to think about that too.” He continued: “It doesn’t matter how big a brand you are, you have the opportunity to show up authentically and not just talk to this [community], but build with [them]. If you look at the brands that did, they worked to make sure that they were paying homage to Puerto Rico, one way or another.” Bad Bunny’s Love Letter to Puerto Rico Earns His Label a Cannes Lions Grand Prix Boricua fan experiences While No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí is a moment in and of itself, additional fan experiences have surrounded the main attraction, courtesy of brand sponsors like Vibee, Ritz, and Method. Vibee partnered with Bad Bunny’s label, Rimas Entertainment, and local creative agency, Upside Down, for Seguimo’ Aquí: The Experience by Vibee, its “largest single-location hotel partnership to date,” president Harvey Cohen told ADWEEK. The immersive, multi-sensory experience resembles a traditional Puerto Rican home and garden, with additional touchpoints such as: a cave installation inspired by the local legend of El Pozo de Jacinto, a bar modeled after the central plaza found in many Puerto Rican towns, and VIP gifting kits. “The Latin community represents one of the most passionate and engaged fan bases in the world,” Vibee’s president, Harvey Cohen, told ADWEEK. “For Vibee, it’s important to honor that cultural richness by creating experiences that feel localized and celebratory.” Seguimo’ Aqu&iacute;: The Experience by Vibee. Vibee Similarly, as the official snacking sponsor of the residency, Ritz brought its “Salty Club” to life earlier this month with a pop-up activation equipped with a photo booth and exclusive merch like a limited-edition Ritz Crackers box featuring artwork nodding to the event. The Mondelēz International brand first debuted the “Salty Club” in its first Super Bowl spot featuring Bad Bunny earlier this year. For the residency, it also held a giveaway leading up to its August activation, offering fans a chance to score tickets to the show with all travel and accommodation costs paid for. Steven Saenen, Mondelēz’s U.S. savory snacking category president, told ADWEEK that the Latino community is Ritz’s top multicultural audience. He also shared that the initial partnership with Bad Bunny came naturally since the musician is “genuinely a fan” of the brand. “It’s important to us because we already have a lot of strength with that cohort [and] we want to keep that going because it’s also a demographic that’s growing,” the exec said. “We have deliberate efforts to continue to engage with them and create meaningful connections. One other example is [our] new partnership with Inter Miami this year.” Ritz’s Salty Club Ritz Meanwhile, Method established a presence in a more unexpected yet high-traffic location within the venue: the restrooms. The personal care brand decked out restrooms across the venue for a campaign called “ Pa’l Recuerdo ,” (or “a souvenir ,”) which was “designed to transform everyday routines into rich, sensory experiences that honor culture and create space for presence,” the brand told ADWEEK in a statement. Pa’l recuerdo is reflective of the “beauty and vibrancy of Puerto Rican culture,” housing exclusive gifts and merchandise, such as a limited-edition body wash and a waterproof speaker for guests to enjoy beyond the experience. Per the brand’s internal research, 75% of Latino consumers said that music is a key part of their shower ritual. As the residency’s official body wash and hand wash sponsor, Method’s goal was to create an emotional connection with existing and potential Latino consumers, a demographic that overindexes on its personal care products. method’s pa’l recuerdo method No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí marks the second music event Method has sponsored. For the past two years, it has also been the official body and hair care partner of Coachella . Beyond Puerto Rico Following No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí, Bad Bunny will embark on his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour , starting November 21 and ending July 22, 2026. While Method plans to bring pa’l recuerdo to fans at his London stops, Saenen remained tight-lipped on whether Ritz will activate around the tour or not. “Latinos are so loyal to brands and the things [we] believe in, and I think in the long run [brands] showing up and continuing to show up are going to be affiliated with this community and [we’re] going to rock with you,” said Lopez-Ixta.

Google is adding embedded link carousels to AI Mode on desktop. The company trained its AI models to predict where users want additional information. Google aims to show more contextual links rather than simple link lists. SEJ STAFF Matt G. Southern 6 hours ago ⋅ 2 min read SEJ STAFF Matt G.

Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, outlined changes designed to make links more visible. Stein wrote on X that Google has been testing where links appear inside AI answers and that the long-term &ldquo;north star&rdquo; is to show more inline links. He added that people are more likely to click when links are embedded with context directly in the response. Stein stated: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been experimenting with how and where to show links in ways that are most helpful to users and sites... our long term north star is to show more inline links.&rdquo; 1/ Excited about the work the team is doing to create AI experiences in Search that highlight useful links and encourage onward exploration.

Google has launched carousels that surface multiple source links directly inside AI Mode responses on desktop. Stein said mobile support is coming soon. The idea is to present links with enough context to help people decide where to go next without hunting below the answer. 2/ We&rsquo;ve found that people really prefer and are more likely to click links that are embedded within AI Mode responses, when they have more context on what they&rsquo;re clicking and where they want to dig deeper. We&rsquo;ve launched embedded link carousels in AI Mode responses on desktop,... — Robby Stein (@rmstein) August 25, 2025 Smarter Inline Links Google is rolling out model updates that decide where inline links appear within the response text. The system is trained to place links at moments when people are most likely to click out to see where information came from or to learn more. Stein noted you might see fluctuations over the next few weeks as this is deployed, with a longer-term push toward more inline links overall. 3/ We&rsquo;re also launching some model updates to improve how we show inline links (links that are embedded directly within text) in AI Mode responses. We train the model to understand where and when people are most likely to want to click out, see where info is coming from and learn... — Robby Stein (@rmstein) August 25, 2025 Web Guide Separately, Google&rsquo;s Web Guide experiment uses a custom Gemini model to group useful links by topic. It launched in Search Labs on the &ldquo;Web&rdquo; tab and, for opted-in users, will begin appearing on the main &ldquo;All&rdquo; tab when systems determine it could help for a query. Google introduced Web Guide in July and indicated it would expand beyond the Web tab over time. 4/ We&rsquo;re also expanding our Web Guide experiment in Labs, which is a new approach to intelligently surfacing and organizing the most useful web links with AI – even for your hardest queries. We&rsquo;ve gotten some really positive feedback as we&rsquo;ve tested this on the &ldquo;Web&rdquo; tab. So in... — Robby Stein (@rmstein) August 25, 2025 Why It Matters How Google presents links in AI Mode can influence how people reach your site. Placing carousels within the answer and adjusting inline placements differ from links that appear only below the response. This may change click behavior depending on the query and presentation. Looking Ahead Google is trying to strike a balance between innovation and supporting publishers. Expect continued testing around link density, placement, and labeling as Google refines AI mode.

Members Online • _BenRichards SEO impact for large website using CSR I have a potential client in the environmental sector sector who operates a large web property (over 2M pages) that they want to replatform. The current site is built on a dead stack and they’re wanting to move to React/Next/GraphQL due to security, client-side performance and scaling problems. Because they’re a nonprofit the budget is tight, and data is constantly changing for their node locations; so pre-rendering is off the table. SSR is problematic due to their current hardware to which there is limited budget for improve (so my guess is that won’t happen). The CTO is wanting to only CSR then front everything via CDN. While this should be fine for researchers I’m fairly certain this will tank their SEO. I’m able to call a lot of this out in my contract, but being a huge fan of CYA, does anyone know the time delta from when the initial DOM structure gets indexed by Google, then JS rendering crawlers will parse the page , then the rendered data gets scored and shows up in SERP so I can call that out? Also a gut check on the processing flow would be helpful. Read more Share",

    "essence": "Home Marketing Don't just grow to grow: Real talk from a serial founder Don't just grow to grow: Real talk from a serial founder Written by: Curt del Principe MASTERS IN MARKETING No fluff, only first-hand expert advice and curated marketing trends from across the web. Subscribe Now Updated: 08/27/25 There are some lessons you only learn when life hits you hard. This week’s master stared down the loss of his business — “All of Q4 was the biggest punch in the face for me that year. It was the most stressed I’ve ever been in my life.” — and came out the other side with a six-figure agency. Today, he shares the kind of vulnerability and real talk you rarely get from entrepreneurs. And his advice just might help you duck a punch. Ryan Atkinson Founder and CEO at Spacebar Visuals ; Host of The UpFlip Podcast Fun fact: In business school, Ryan got the lowest grade in a class called Founders Club. He went on to grow his own six-figure business. Claim to fame: Named to Austin’s 25 Under 25 and the Tippie Young Alumni Board. His podcast about entrepreneurship has hit over 2 million downloads. Lesson 1: Don’t just grow to grow. If you believe the hustle-culture hype that thrives on LinkedIn, the only way to get ahead is to eat and breathe the grind, right? I’d say “eat, sleep, and breathe,” but the grind never sleeps. “I thought when I [created] Spacebar, I wanted to grow as much as possible, hire as much as possible,” Ryan Atkinson says. And his business did grow — second only to his stress levels. “This is probably TMI, but I had canker sores from stress. I couldn’t even listen to music, because music would make me anxious,” he confesses. Atkinson reached a point where he had to reevaluate both his business and life goals and consider what he was growing toward. (Something that many entrepreneurs won’t admit.) His advice to you solopreneurs, startup founders, and small business owners? “ The goal is still growth, but it’s not growth at all costs. Grow to hire correctly. Grow profitably. Grow mindfully.” Lesson 2: It’s okay to start cheap. Video is no longer a nice-to-have for marketers, but that doesn’t mean you have to drop half your net worth making the next Marvel movie. “Let's say you're a startup company, where you have a limited budget. You can't spend 20 grand on a video. Honestly, Upwork is a great place to get started. ” I took a sip of my tea just so I could do a spit-take. The solution isn’t to write a check to his video agency? “It doesn’t have to be Spacebar,” Atkinson laughs. “But you can’t do an iPhone type of video if you want to make a good first impression on prospects.” “If you’re a startup marketer, you have 1,000 things you need to be doing. You have reporting. You have campaigns. You have email marketing. And video is not easy to get right. So, go to Upwork, find someone that can do it for $500, $900.” To be clear, he’s not talking about dropping that cash on run-of-the-mill TikTok posts. This is about investing in videos that meet your audience at key steps on their buyer’s journey. “You want to have a top-of-funnel explainer video because people need to know who you are. You want a brand overview video. And you want a product demo that brings your product to life. If you could only do three assets with video, do those. ” Atkinson went on to break down exact recommendations for each of those videos, but since I couldn’t squeeze ’em into one newsletter, I’ve linked a longer guide down below. Lesson 3: Podcast for a different purpose. As a fractional podcast host, Atkinson has helped launch more podcasts than most people have consumed. So I asked him the key to getting a successful show up and running. “Growing a podcast is incredibly hard. It’s almost impossible to do it independently now,” he admits. “ I love podcasting so much, but the more I get into it, the more I’m realizing it truly is pay-to-play. ” Atkinson explains that unless you can pay for broad distribution, or unless you’ve got a ready-made audience — say on LinkedIn or in a newsletter — it’s unlikely you’ll grow to a point where monetizing your podcast is worth the time you put in it. But even if you’re never a top 100 podcast in your niche, there are other reasons to do it. “Podcasts can be reused as a blog post, email, [or] for SEO.” Not to mention repurposed for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn. So even if the podcast itself is slow to gain traction, the effort can pay out in cross-functional content. And your show can even be an icebreaker for those hard-to-reach clients: “We use it sometimes to let us talk with prospects and get introduced to them. Reach out to your [ideal customer profile] like, ‘Hey, you want to be a guest on our podcast?’” Once you interview them, it opens the door to further collaboration and conversation. Just “don’t think you’ll be a top 50, even top 100 podcast in two weeks.” Lingering Questions This Week’s Question “What sparks joy for you?” — Jayde Powell, Founder and head of creative, The Em Dash Co. This Week’s Answer Atkinson says: “Professionally, when you take a bet on something and it works. Personally, being with family, friends, working out, and reading books.” Next Week’s Question Atkinson asks: “ If you could only invest in one tool to help your company grow for the next three years, what tool would it be? ” Don't forget to share this post!",

We’re curious how you all approach the content mix when marketing for clients or your own biz. Like, we all know posting only promotional stuff feels spammy and usually gets ignored. But at the same time, going 100% educational can make people forget you actually offer something. In our experience working with local businesses, the sweet spot seems to be a mix … for example, 70% helpful/educational and 30% light promotion sprinkled in. But even then, what “educational” means really depends on the audience. For a dentist, it could be tips on daily dental care. Or for a restaurant, maybe behind-the-scenes food prep or local community stories. What always seems to be the biggest struggle is knowing how much promotional content people will actually tolerate before tuning out. Do you tie promotions into the educational stuff (like case studies that double as success stories)? Or keep them separate? What’s been your best-performing mix, and how do you keep it from feeling like an ad feed? Read more Share",

Amazon restarted spending on Google Shopping ads across its international domains, exactly one month after abruptly pausing them – a move that now looks like a deliberate marketing test. The details: All international domains are once again running Shopping ads. The U.S. market remains excluded, raising questions about competitive strategy and channel mix. The month-long pause lines up with theories that Amazon was stress-testing reliance on Google traffic. Why we care. Amazon is one of Google&rsquo;s largest retail advertisers, and its absence reshaped the auction. When Amazon went dark, clicks rose for other retailers , but ROAS dropped , a study from Optmyzr found. This suggests that Amazon&rsquo;s presence helps keep traffic more efficient, even for competitors. The big picture . Amazon&rsquo;s selective return highlights its ability to flex advertising muscle while experimenting with acquisition costs. For rivals, the U.S. gap could be a rare window to grab market share before Amazon inevitably flips the switch back on. First seen.

    "essence": "Search Engine Land » PPC » Article Google Ads adds loyalty features to boost shopper retention Published: August 26, 2025 at 2:45 pm Read Time: 2 minutes Share Written by Anu Adegbola Table of Contents Table of Contents Google is baking loyalty perks into ads and listings, letting retailers turn member benefits into higher clicks and longer-term value. Google is rolling out new loyalty integrations across Google Ads and Merchant Center, giving retailers tools to highlight member-only pricing and shipping benefits to their most valuable customers. How it works: Personalized annotations display member-only discounts or shipping benefits in both free and paid listings. A new loyalty goal in Google Ads helps retailers optimize budgets toward high-value shoppers, adjusting bids to prioritize lifetime value. Sephora US saw a 20% lift in CTR by surfacing loyalty-tier discounts in personalized ads. Why we care. With 61% of U.S. adults saying tailored loyalty programs are the most compelling part of a personalized shopping experience (according to Google), retailers face pressure to prove value beyond discounts. By surfacing member-only perks directly in search and shopping results, retailers can boost engagement from their most valuable customers and optimize spend toward higher lifetime value, not just single conversions. It&rsquo;s a way to tie loyalty programs directly to ad performance — and win more share of wallet from existing shoppers. The big picture . Loyalty features are Google&rsquo;s latest move to keep retail advertisers invested in its ecosystem — positioning search and shopping as not just discovery channels, but retention engines.

More than 1 in 5 Americans now use AI tools heavily – but traditional search engines remain dominant, with usage holding steady at 95%, according to new clickstream data from Datos and SparkToro. By the numbers: AI tools: 21% of U.S. users access AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Perplexity, and Deepseek 10+ times per month. Overall adoption has jumped from 8% in 2023 to 38% in 2025. Search engines: 95% of Americans still use Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo monthly, with 87% considered heavy Google users – up from 84% in 2023. Growth trends: AI adoption is slowing. Since September 2024, no month has shown more than 1.1x growth. By contrast, search volume per user has slightly increased year-over-year. The big picture: Despite the hype around AI replacing Google, the data seems to show the opposite. When people adopt AI tools, their Google searches also rise, SparkToro found. This echoes a Semrush study that found ChatGPT users search more , not less. Yes, but. Are there any truly &ldquo;traditional search engines&rdquo; left? Things get a bit messy when talking about &ldquo;traditional search engines&rdquo; versus the &ldquo;AI tools&rdquo; examined here, because all search engines now have AI baked in: Google is a traditional search engine (or, perhaps more accurately, an AI search engine with a legacy search experience that&rsquo;s clearly moving in the direction of AI Overviews and AI Mode), and Gemini is Google&rsquo;s AI tool. Plus, Google&rsquo;s traditional search data is being used by ChatGPT . Traditional search engine Bing has its own AI tool, Copilot, and is OpenAI&rsquo;s partner for ChatGPT Search, and feeds DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s results. Why we care . This data once again indicates that it isn&rsquo;t AI vs. search; it&rsquo;s AI plus search. Heavy AI users are also heavy searchers, meaning Google traffic declines are more about zero-click answers than AI cannibalization. The report.

The August spam update started August 26 and applies worldwide. Expect possible ranking and traffic swings during the multi-week rollout.

Southern Senior News Writer at Search Engine Journal Bio Follow 2.2K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Google launched a new spam update that will affect search results worldwide. According to the Search Status Dashboard , the August spam update began today at 9:00 AM Pacific Time. It applies globally to all languages and may take a few weeks to complete. Today we released the August 2025 spam update. It may take a few weeks to complete, and we'll post on the Google Search Status Dashboard when the rollout is done: https://t.co/VyY24LVujq — Google Search Central (@googlesearchc) August 26, 2025 What Google Confirmed Google&rsquo;s incident note reads: &ldquo;Released the August 2025 spam update, which applies globally and to all languages. The rollout may take a few weeks to complete.&rdquo; No additional details were provided about specific tactics targeted. Multi-week rollouts are typical for major search updates and allow Google to monitor impact and adjust as needed. How to Respond Google hasn&rsquo;t specified targeted behaviors for this update, so the safest course is to stay aligned with established quality and spam policies. Expect some ranking and traffic volatility while the update rolls out. Avoid reactive changes during the rollout window. What to watch: Search Console trends : Impressions, clicks, average position—annotate dashboards with the official start time. Query and page-type patterns : Look for consistent movement across groups, not just single URLs. Peer movement : Compare shifts against close competitors to separate site issues from ecosystem changes. Looking Ahead Spam updates are one part of Google&rsquo;s broader ranking systems and typically ship multiple times per year alongside core updates. Sites that stay within policy guidelines should be well-positioned once rankings stabilize. Search Engine Journal will continue to monitor the update as it rolls out and provide updates when available. Featured Image: PJ McDonnell /Shutterstock Category News SEO",

    "essence": "Search Engine Land » SEO » Article ChatGPT’s answers came from Google Search after all: Report Published: August 26, 2025 at 11:33 am Read Time: 2 minutes Share Written by Danny Goodwin Table of Contents Table of Contents Even ChatGPT leaned on Google’s search results via a scraping service – underscoring how crucial Google’s index remains in the AI search era. Multiple tests have suggested ChatGPT is using Google Search . Well, a new report seems to confirm ChatGPT is indeed using Google Search data. OpenAI quietly used (and may still be using) a Google Search scraping service to power ChatGPT&rsquo;s answers on real-time topics like news, sports, and finance, according to The Information. The details. OpenAI used SerpApi, an 8-year-old scraping firm, to extract Google results. SerpApi reportedly listed OpenAI as a customer on its site as recently as May 2024. That listing was later removed for unknown reasons. ( Here&rsquo;s evidence via the Wayback Machine .) Google has reportedly long tried to block SerpApi&rsquo;s crawler, though it&rsquo;s unclear how effective those efforts have been. Other SerpApi customers reportedly include Meta, Apple, and Perplexity. Zoom out. This revelation contrasts with OpenAI&rsquo;s public stance that ChatGPT search relies on its own crawler, Microsoft Bing, and licensed publisher data. During Google&rsquo;s antitrust trial, ChatGPT exec Nick Turley indicated Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing had &ldquo;significant quality issues&rdquo; and indicated that Google&rsquo;s index would accelerate OpenAI&rsquo;s search ambitions. Meanwhile. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently dismissed Google Search , saying: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use Google anymore. I legitimately cannot tell you the last time I did a Google search.&rdquo; Well, based on this news, it seems like he probably is using Google Search all the time within his own product. Why we care . Google&rsquo;s search index remains the foundation of online discovery – so much so that even its biggest AI search rival appears to be using it to partially power ChatGPT. This is yet another reminder that SEO isn&rsquo;t going anywhere just yet. If Google&rsquo;s results are valuable to OpenAI, they remain essential for driving visibility, traffic, and business outcomes. The report.

Protect Your Brand From Ad Hijacking Learn how to detect ad hijacking , stop affiliate abuse, and protect your traffic in 2025. What Is Ad Hijacking ? Ad hijacking , by definition, is a form of advertising fraud where someone pretends to be your brand in paid search ads (like Google or other platforms). The fraudsters copy your brand name, your ad style, even your messaging, so the ad looks real. But when a customer clicks, they&rsquo;re sent somewhere else. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 There are two common types: Affiliate ad hijacking. Competitor ad hijacking. What Is Affiliate Ad Hijacking? Affiliate ad hijacking happens when partners in your affiliate program bid on your brand name. They: copy your ad (same headline, same style) so it looks like the real thing. The Result: The customer thinks they&rsquo;re clicking on your official site because the ad looks the same. But behind the scenes, the affiliate redirects the traffic through their own tracking link. You end up paying them a commission for a customer who was already looking for you. This inflates your costs, pollutes your data, and makes it harder to measure real performance. Example: A user searches for [Super Tools]. An affiliate runs an ad with the headline &ldquo;Super Tools Official Site,&rdquo; but the link is an affiliate redirect. You pay them a cut, even though they didn&rsquo;t bring in new traffic. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 What Is Competitor Ad Hijacking? Competitor ad hijacking is when a rival company copies your brand in search ads to steal your traffic. They: bid on your brand name, use ad text that looks like yours, sometimes even mimic your domain. The Result : Customers click, thinking they&rsquo;re going to your site. But instead, they land on the competitor&rsquo;s website. This tactic lets competitors capture high-intent traffic. As a result, you lose potential sales, while they gain market share. Without PPC brand protection, your brand presence can be weakened, allowing competitors to grow faster at your expense. Example: A competitor bids on &ldquo;Super Tools&rdquo; and runs a lookalike ad. The user clicks, expecting your site, but lands on the competitor&rsquo;s product page instead. You lose a sale and possibly the customer&rsquo;s trust. As you see, search hijacking is already a serious threat to your brand and budget. It&rsquo;s made even worse by how well the violators hide their tracks. Secret Tactics That Are Used To Hide Ad Hijacking Non-compliant partners use smart tactics to avoid being seen by brand owners or their teams. Here&rsquo;s how they do it: GEO targeting. Ads are shown only in specific countries, cities, or regions. If you&rsquo;re not in that area, you&rsquo;ll never see them – but your local customers will. Dayparting. Hijackers run ads at night, on weekends, or during holidays when your team is less likely to notice them. Cloaking and dynamic redirects. They use scripts to show one version of the ad or landing page to Google (to pass review) and a different one to users – usually a fake or affiliate redirect. Smaller search engines. Many hijackers avoid Google and run campaigns on Bing or other second-tier platforms, where rules are looser and tracking is weaker. Without proper hijacking prevention , these tactics make it easy for hijackers to hide and hard for your team to catch them in time. Direct Impact Of Ad Hijacking On Your Company The impact of affiliate ad hijacking goes far beyond a few stolen clicks. It damages performance, costs money, and creates serious risks for your business: Lost ad budget. You pay commissions to affiliates who didn&rsquo;t bring you new traffic; they just hijacked what was already yours. Higher CPC and more competition. Hijackers bid on your brand keywords, driving up your costs and competing against your own campaigns. Broken attribution. Without hijacking prevention, your analytics get messy. It becomes harder to measure what&rsquo;s really working because affiliate hijacking inflates performance data. Reputation damage. Users may land on shady or misleading pages. They won&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s not your site – they&rsquo;ll just stop trusting your brand. Compliance risks. If you&rsquo;re in a regulated industry (finance, health, etc.), fake ads and unapproved messaging can create legal trouble or policy violations. Search hijacking doesn&rsquo;t just hurt your numbers. It makes you question the data you rely on, wastes hours chasing false leads, and forces you to fight for traffic that was already yours. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 85% of consumers avoid buying from brands that generate unsafe experiences, and ad hijacking falls into that bucket (PwC Report). 75% of ad hijacking comes from affiliate partners exploiting tracking gaps to earn unearned commissions (Neilpatel). Up to 30% of affiliate commissions come from hijacking and similar deceptive tactics (AffiliateWP). Ad hijacking caused an estimated $12.6 billion in losses in 2023, based on 15% of the $84 billion lost to ad fraud globally (Juniper Research). How To Spot And Prevent Ad Hijacking What actually works on PPC brand protection? To uncover real issues, you need tools and methods that go beyond surface metrics: Step 1: Quick Manual Checks Run branded keyword searches and audit SERPs – look for near-identical copy linking to another domain. Watch for anomalies in performance (CPC spikes, conversion drops, affiliate surges). Review affiliate conversion patterns – unusual regional spikes may signal fraud. Geo-test with VPNs or third-party tools to uncover geo-targeted hijacks. Track impression share – sudden drops without budget changes mean new competition. Step 2: Scalable Prevention Tactics Behavioral simulation : Mimic real user searches across devices and browsers to reveal hidden hijacks. Geo-rotation & proxy use : Detect localized hijacking attempts. Proof collection : Document ads, redirects, affiliate IDs, and keywords for enforcement. Real-time alerts & auto takedown : Get notified instantly and stop fraudulent ads before they drain your budget. By combining manual checks and scalable tools, you can take control before search hijacking quietly eats into your ad spend. Modern Tools To Catch What Manual Audits Miss Manual checks can&rsquo;t keep up with how ad hijacking works today. Hijackers often run ads only in certain regions, at non-working hours, or under specific conditions. They use cloaking and redirects that can&rsquo;t be detected with regular checks. Most teams lack the time and capability to ensure hijacking prevention through manual monitoring alone. That&rsquo;s why ad hijacking tools like Bluepear are essential – as PPC brand protection software, they automate continuous scanning of search results to catch every sneaky ad trying to hijack your traffic and budget. Here&rsquo;s how Bluepear helps to fight against ad hijacking: Simulates real user behavior.

If you want to survive in a world of smart fraud, automated PPC brand protection is a must. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 Protect Your Brand From Ad Hijacking Ad hijacking quietly eats into your ad budget, distorts your performance data, and damages user trust.

The ad hijacking tool automatically checks SERPs from different GEOs, devices, and browsers to keep your brand protected from fraud.

I’m the sole marketing person at a financial institution of about 120. 3x per month, I’m responsible for sending out our “loan bonus” email to our loan broker network. These are not small bonuses, some loan broker shops can earn over $300k a month just in bonuses. Many of these loan brokers don’t share the bonus program with their employees , and want us to only email specific people about it (they keep the $ for their leadership team). Every time before I send a bonus email, I get MAJOR anxiety about accidentally emailing the bonus to a loan broker shop employee that shouldn’t know about it (their employees are sales people selling our product). We have list filtering but I’m always worried one person slipped through (our sales team checks off who can get it in Salesforce, but they’ve made mistakes before). If the wrong person gets it, it could ruin a multi-million dollar relationship with a broker that does business with us. I always spot check but there are over 500 recipients. How can I manage my anxiety about this? Read more Share",

Perplexity 'Comet Plus' pays publishers for visits, citations, and agent actions. Available on its own, or included with Pro and Max subscriptions. Revenue is shared with websites, minus a small compute fee. SEJ STAFF Matt G. Southern 18 hours ago ⋅ 2 min read SEJ STAFF Matt G. Southern Senior News Writer at Search Engine Journal Bio Follow 506 READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Perplexity announced Comet Plus, a monthly subscription that pays participating publishers when people read their work and when AI systems use it to answer questions. The company says subscriber payments go to partners, with a small portion retained to cover compute costs. How Comet Plus Works Comet Plus will be available for $5 per month. Existing Perplexity Pro and Max subscribers will have Comet Plus included. Subscribers get direct access to participating publisher sites, answers informed by those sources, and agent workflows that can complete tasks on those sites. The offering is tied to the Comet browser and assistant. About Revenue Sharing Perplexity positions Comet Plus as a compensation model for an AI-centric web. Publishers are paid for three interaction types: Human visits Search citations Agent actions. Perplexity&rsquo;s example of &ldquo;agent traffic&rdquo; is Comet Assistant scanning a calendar and suggesting relevant reading from publisher sites. The idea is to reflect how people now consume information across browsing, AI answers, and agent workflows. Perplexity wrote: &ldquo;Comet Plus is the first compensation model... based on three types of internet traffic: human visits, search citations, and agent actions.&rdquo; Availability Interested publishers can email publishers@perplexity.ai to request to join the program. Why It Matters For publishers and marketers, the model expands monetization and measurement beyond traditional clicks. Websites are testing a range of responses to AI usage of their content, from blocking crawlers to signing licenses. Comet Plus differs from flat-fee deals by tying payouts to actual user and assistant activity, which could align compensation more closely with real demand. Looking Ahead Perplexity says it will announce an initial roster of publishing partners when the Comet browser becomes available to all users for free. Early adoption, reporting transparency, and real revenue for partners will determine whether this model becomes a viable framework or stays a niche experiment. Category News Generative AI",

What would you do to beat the industry leader? Question I am a bit upset with this whole marketing world... Maybe I am just jealous... Case studies are often rigged - in terms of big corps have the power to \"push through\" SEO, Google Ads easily, and can test everything with their \"endless\" money. For, little brands, they have to hack everything and figure out what works on a lower scale... E.g. if you want to launch a Pmax campaign, but in a very, very niche IT security B2B enterprise market, and the competitor has 100x more resources, and they do not need leads from Google Ads they are just there to brand themselves - but because of this, the price is so high that you can not test anything… Free market my ass :D Sorry for venting this.

Download the Free Templates Updated: 08/26/25 A few years ago, I was in charge of presenting a big marketing strategy deck to a senior executive. My team and I prepared a script that went something like this: “In Q3, we’ll deliver a unified editorial calendar. Subject matter will reinforce key audience pain points. We will increase paid media investments to leverage this series in integrated campaigns.” It sounded so impressive in my head, but the executive just wanted clarity. She asked, “So, what is it exactly? A blog series we promote in paid?” Oops. In that moment, I realized the words I was using were all wrong. I wasn’t just doing this in meetings. I was adopting this voice in all the brand’s content I was creating, too. I call that jargon-filled approach “content voice.” And since that meeting, I’ve been on a mission to stop its spread — both in my work and at other brands. Let’s break down exactly what content voice means and how to avoid it, along with some real examples of brands that get it right. Table of Contents What is content voice? Your voice should feel like a distinct logo. 5 Tips for Developing a Strong & Cohesive Brand Voice Examples of a Strong Brand Voice What is content voice? Content voice is when brands use fancy-sounding jargon in the content they create for their audience instead of communicating simply. Here’s what it looks like IRL. @heike.young I’m so embarrassed of my work voice. When I’m WFH and someone hears it, I feel like I’m wearing a little monocle 💀 Does your corporate self wear a monocle too or are you normal? #corporate #corporatelife ♬ original sound - Heike Young 🤓 When I posted about content voice on LinkedIn , my comments section exploded with people who knew exactly what I meant. Content voice is saying “utilize” or “leverage” instead of “use.” It’s customers reading multiple paragraphs about what your product does but still not understanding it. When you read something written in content voice, you can tell it’s marketing content, making it feel less personal and valuable. In my experience, speaking in your regular, non-content voice is a much better bet. Sticking to a clear, accessible voice for your brand is critical to make sure your internal and external stakeholders actually understand what you’re talking about. Instead of complicated, inaccessible language, just use the same words you’d use to explain your idea to a friend over coffee. I know this might seem tough, especially in B2B. But your customers will thank you for explaining things clearly. At the end of the day, we’re all human, so there’s no need to talk like a robot. Instead, just use regular, jargon-free words, and do your best to communicate as clearly (and as humanly) as possible.

You're all set! Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now Your voice should feel like a distinct logo. So, you’ve cut all the jargon out of your style guide. That’s just the first step. Goodbye, content voice. From there, you have to build a brand voice that feels distinct in a sea of sameness. Your brand voice should feel like a logo, memorable and distinct. Any time I interact with your brand, I should automatically recognize it from the words you use. Your brand voice should be authentic to your offering and your audience. And it should span your social channels, blog content, company podcasts, and newsletters. Ideally, I’d be able to say, “I’d recognize that voice anywhere.” 5 Tips for Developing a Strong & Cohesive Brand Voice How do you actually develop a voice like that? Here are some tried-and-true tips to help marketers develop a strong and cohesive brand voice. 1. Listen to understand. Especially as a junior marketer, I often assumed that the point of communicating was to sound smart. It didn’t matter if I had no idea what I was talking about, as long as I sounded impressive. But to develop a brand voice that’s clear and intelligible, it’s essential to actually understand the subject matter. And, that starts with really listening. So, when interviewing leaders or customers, ask plenty of questions. Don’t be afraid to ask the same thing multiple times to get the information you need. Then, once you really understand their answers, you can use that understanding to communicate more effectively. 2. Define niche terms. In general, it’s best to use simple language that everyone can easily understand. But of course, you can’t always avoid niche terms. When an industry-specific term is necessary, it’s okay to use it. Just remember to define the term, rather than assuming that everyone will already know what it means. You can define the same term in multiple pieces of content. Don’t assume everyone’s read everything you create. 3. Advocate for your audience. Talking like a regular person may not seem all that counterintuitive, but I’ve found that sooner or later, you’re likely to run into some pushback. Whether it’s an overzealous colleague or an old-fashioned senior executive, it’s not uncommon for marketers to find themselves dealing with people trying to edit their work to make it more jargon-y. If and when that happens, it’s vital to serve as an advocate for your audience. Of course, this conversation can be uncomfortable (even more so if it’s with your boss or someone who has a lot more experience than you). But if you explain that you’re just trying to make the content as clear as possible, then you should be able to get the buy-in you need. That’s especially true for global audiences, many of whom may natively speak a different language than you do. Those folks will definitely appreciate when you avoid jargon-filled copy. 4. Use data to back up your approach. Beyond just explaining that using regular language will naturally help more people understand what you’re saying, I bet you can also find data to support the benefits of this approach. The metrics that matter most will depend on your unique industry and business context, but see if you can find evidence proving that using a regular voice leads to more time spent on your website, higher conversion rates, and other valuable improvements. In general, I’m guessing if you test regular voice vs. content voice website headings or landing page copy, the regular voice will win. 5. Lead by example. Finally, if you’re in a leadership role, be proactive about your brand’s voice and tone. After all, junior writers and editors will be emulating you. If you use pompous, confusing language, they’ll get the message that sounding fancy is the way to succeed. But if you talk like a regular person, people will naturally follow your lead. In addition, make sure to praise marketers for using clear language. When reviewing their content, always look for opportunities to simplify. You can also formalize brand voice guidelines, explicitly encouraging people to avoid corporate jargon and prioritize accessibility. But of course, people will only follow those rules if they see their leaders sticking to them, too. Even if you’re not in a leadership role, you can still lead by example, though, and make a push inside your company for clearer language. Examples of a Strong Brand Voice So, what does this look like in practice? Here are a few examples of brands using a strong, clear voice without sounding pretentious. Mailchimp: Striking the Balance Between Business and Pleasure B2B brands have a tough mission. They need to be distinct and have personality while selling technical solutions. How can you possibly showcase a B2B offering without using jargon? Mailchimp finds a way. The email marketing and automation platform strikes the right balance between helpful content and vibe. Its how-to guides give real steps that can help marketers create effective email campaigns, all while keeping jargon to a minimum. On social, Mailchimp continues to lead with value, like in their LinkedIn carousels that offer deep, but brief, insights for the audience. Source The Hustle: The No-BS Approach to Business Newsletter The Hustle offers business news without content voice. The publication offers a “no-BS source for the business stories that matter.” All of the brand’s content — from social media posts to the newsletter itself — has the same conversational tone. The brand‘s personality shines through in their subject lines too, with headers like, “Why everyone’s suddenly obsessed with pickleball.” I see something punchy in my inbox and want to click through. And, once I get to the content, I know that I won’t need an MBA to understand it. Canva: Keeping the Product Fun, Front, and Center When I think of graphic design, I think creativity, fun, and finding clever ways to showcase a product. Canva captures that spirit. Instead of defaulting to content voice, the brand has a straightforward and casual tone. There’s no mention of in-the-weeds features. Canva just lets the product do the talking. That approach is all over the brand’s copy, whether that’s on LinkedIn or billboards. Source Source When it comes to brand voice, simpler is better. At the end of the day, I’ve learned that simpler is almost always better. While niche terms have their place, putting on a fancy-sounding “content voice” tends to backfire: Instead of sounding smart, you just sound like you’re marketing something complicated. Instead, I always recommend that marketers focus on clarity. That means using simple words and prioritizing accessibility. And when in doubt, just try to sound like a human.

I just saw one on Facebook — it was a brand I've never heard of promoting a product I’d never buy. I'm not the brand’s target audience, and that brand is missing out by not understanding who to market their product towards. No company can market to everyone — so who are you selling to? That's the question that your target audience answers. Good targeting speaks directly to a specific group, making viewers feel connected with the brand. Understanding target audiences is key to any successful marketing strategy. Every product and service has a target audience, no matter how niche. In this article, I'll walk you through how to perform a target audience analysis for your brand. Table of Contents What is a target audience? Target Market vs Target Audience Types of Target Audiences How to Find Your Target Audience Target Audience Examples What is a target audience? “Target audience” refers to a group of consumers characterized by shared qualities like demographic data, behaviors, interests, etc. Most companies and products will have multiple target audiences representing diverse products and user groups. Brands identify their target consumers by articulating audience features to create a clear picture of who the potential customer is. This image clarifies brand messaging, focuses marketing efforts, and even guides what products to develop next. For example, a wine company can't sell to both high-end wine aficionados and novice wine drinkers. Through target audience research, they could identify their target wine drinkers as those ages 24 to 30 who have an interest in wine but limited budgets. Knowing their audience, they can focus on appealing to those buyers instead of trying to appeal to everyone. Is it the same as a buyer persona ? No — your target audience represents your entire potential consumer group. Your buyer persona is a fictional representation of one target audience member.

Download Now Target Market vs Target Audience Both target market and target audience are ways of grouping customers for segmentation. However, “target market” refers to the broader group of potential customers. The target audience sits within the target market and is a more specific segment. Let's use an example of the IKEA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Target market : People in western Pennsylvania. Target audience : People in western Pennsylvania who want to buy budget-friendly furniture. One potential target segment : Expectant parents in western Pennsylvania who need budget-friendly nursery furniture. After identifying a target segment, you then create buyer personas that represent the detailed emotions and needs of each customer segment. Are the terms making more sense? Don ' t worry, this isn’t a test and you won't fail — as long as you focus on understanding the people who buy your product. Types of Target Audiences The world doesn't need more generic marketing campaigns. Personalization is key, and it’s something that modern consumers expect. A Boston Consulting Group (BCG) survey found that more than 80% of respondents reported wanting and expecting personalized experiences. This is achieved by focusing on your brand's different target audience types. Here they are at a glance: Demographics : Who your customer is Customer journey stage : How well they know your brand Interests : How customers spend their time Subcultures : Relevant customer identities Values : What matters most to your buyers Let's look at what makes these special, plus pull real-life examples to learn from. Demographics Demographic segmentation divides a market into smaller categories based on variable characteristics such as age, race, gender, marital status, income, education, and nationality. Each demographic factor influences consumer behavior and product preferences. For example: Gender : Consumers often make fashion, beauty, and health purchases that align with their gender identity. Marketing strategies often differ when targeting men, women, or non-binary shoppers. Income : Economic status influences buying power, impacting what products or services consumers can afford. Age : Product preferences can vary significantly between different age groups, as do advertising media and ad campaigns. For example, AARP's business strategy is built on age segmentation: the brand targets individuals who are at retirement age or pre-retirement age. This is clearly reflected in marketing materials like this Facebook post about “elderspeak.” Demographic data is acquired through censuses, market surveys, and analytical tools. Customer Journey Stages The term “customer journey” refers to the different touchpoints that a customer has with a brand. Common stages include product awareness, consideration, purchase, and retention. When targeting different points of the customer journey, your marketing should address questions like: Awareness : What is this product? Consideration : Why should I buy? Purchase : Is this product right for me? Retention : Why should I buy again? This type of targeting is effective because it delivers the exact messaging people need, given their familiarity with the product. Let's look at electrolyte company Liquid IV as an example and see how they create content targeting the different stages of the customer journey: What is Liquid IV? Awareness content educates prospective buyers on the product pain points and introduces the product as a solution. Why should someone buy it? Consideration content helps users understand product benefits. What's the best product for me right now? Purchase content shares product details and social proof. Why should I buy it again? Retention content encourages repeat purchases by sharing additional product uses. Source Interests Interests represent the hobbies and activities that customers enjoy. Understanding customer interests helps you unearth buyer motivation and behaviors and connect with your audience in a relatable way. One product can have different target groups based on customer interests. Let's use a bicycle as an example. Cyclist A might be interested in racing bikes. This customer wants to burn calories after work by cycling long distances. Cyclist B could enjoy a relaxing bike commute to work. Understanding customer interests as they pertain to your product is crucial in reaching the right buyers. Priority Bicycles caters to the interests of Cyclist B. That's clear through the company slogan: “bicycles for everyday riders.” This clear stance makes it very easy for cyclists to self-select if this company is right for their interests. Source Subcultures Subcultures represent interests, lifestyles, or identities that some of your customers share. They're similar to customer interests, but a subculture is directly tied to identity. People define themselves by their subcultures, and each group has distinctive interests and needs. For example, not all parents are the same. Parents of adult children belong to a different subculture from parents of toddlers. Understanding the subcultures within your target market helps sharpen marketing materials and make groups feel represented. A real-life example of subculture targeting is Liquid Death, a canned water company. The company has been rooted in the music subculture from the beginning. It has maintained that connection to the music industry through social media content, company aesthetic, partnerships, and events. Source Values Consumers have unique values that impact how they live their lives and which brands they monetarily support. Customers who align with a brand's values are more likely to try a product, repeat a purchase, and recommend the product to others. Some values include: Sustainability Transparency Social justice Accessibility Affordability Community Inclusion Diversity These values are more than just talking points: they're deep insights into how consumers see themselves and who they aspire to be. Examining customer values can also help you identify industry trends. For example, an interest in plastic-free product packaging is a manifestation of the public's growing awareness about ocean pollution and landfill contribution. Nuud deodorant knows that its customers care about the environment and the chemicals they use on their bodies. The product aligns with customers' values by being plastic-free, natural, vegan, and cruelty-free. @nuudcare ♬ original sound - nuud | fresh armpits worldwide Tip: This classification is less straightforward than demographics because it deals with subjective internal characteristics that can be harder to measure. Consider trying a customer survey or using social listening tools to gather data on what values align with your product.

Download Now How to Find Your Target Audience Here are five steps you can take to define and refine your target audience. 1. Use HubSpot Analytics to learn more about your customers. According to HubSpot's 2024 State of Marketing report, only 65% of marketers have high-quality data about their target audience . This leaves 35% who don't know their audience definitively. HubSpot Analytics is an excellent tool for gathering demographic details about your audience, as well as real-time analytics about your marketing campaign's performance. Here's some information you can find in the analytics dashboard. Traffic Analytics This tracks your website's performance and other digital assets. It provides metrics like page views, unique visitors, bounce rates, and session duration. You can also see your traffic sources (organic, direct, referrals, social media, etc.), which helps you understand which channels are driving the most engagement. Conversion Analytics HubSpot allows you to track how well your landing pages and other conversion tools are performing. This includes data on form submissions, lead conversions, and the effectiveness of different calls-to-action (CTAs). You can also analyze the conversion paths to optimize the steps your visitors take from entering the site to becoming leads to becoming paid customers. Campaign Analytics Easily measure the performance of each marketing campaign you're running inside of HubSpot. This includes impressions, clicks, conversions, sales, and ROI. This helps you gauge which campaigns are the most effective. Custom Reports HubSpot allows you to create custom reports that fit specific needs. You can pull together various data points from across marketing, sales, and service platforms to create comprehensive reports to meet your unique business requirements. Pro tip: If you're not using HubSpot analytics, you can connect your website to Google Analytics to find demographic data about your target audience, including their age, gender, interests, lifestyle, nationality, and more. 2. Use website data to gauge audience interests. Which website pages are getting the most views, shares, and comments? Both the thriving and floundering pages contain valuable behavioral insights for you to learn from. Start by learning from the top performers. Are there themes between the most popular pages? How are users finding them? How long do users spend on the page, and how far down do they scroll? After reading, do they click around or become an email subscriber? Pro tip: Implement a streamlined navigation menu or sidebar that prominently features your popular content so visitors can easily find these thriving pages. Some businesses highlight their top-performing content on their website in a “trending” or “most popular” section, like Glossier's blog: Source Then, analyze underperforming content. Are there themes between which pages get the least traffic? Are they visible on the website, or are they buried? Are they optimized for search? Is it possible that the pages with low readership are aligned with your audience, but the pages aren't being discovered? I ' ve found that many businesses have quality content buried deep in their blog archives. If you find old pieces aren’t being read but are still valuable, update them for improved search visibility. 3. Analyze social media data for additional insights. Social media channels collect different data from your website that can include robust insights into customer demographics and content preferences. Analyze two types of social media data: Demographic data: Where do customers live? How old are they? Content preferences: What do viewers engage most with? What attracts the most new viewers? What ' s working and what’s not? Every social channel is different and has a diverse audience, so it's essential to look at your analytics across all social platforms . Here's an example of some of the insights you can get from Facebook Analytics: Pro tip: Some platforms, like Facebook, allow you to use detailed demographic information to segment your audience and customize your marketing campaigns. You can effectively tailor your content, messaging, and advertising strategies to match the characteristics and preferences of different audience segments.

Social media is a readily available, free place to conduct market research. Engage with your audience through surveys, interactive polls, and “ask us anything” questionnaires. Use this invaluable two-way medium to ask questions like: How are they using your product? What's their biggest complaint related to the problem you solve? How often do they use your product? This can be done directly on social media platforms — Instagram Stories is probably the most popular place. Alternatively, you can create a formal survey and ask social media followers to participate. Remember: all engagement is valuable, whether it's positive or negative. Pro tip: You can maximize engagement by showcasing the results of your questionnaires. This signals to your audience that their input is valued, which enhances loyalty and attracts new followers. Here's a great survey example from budget bus company FlixBus: Source FlixBus' social media content aligned perfectly with its audience: budget travelers who love a good deal. As a customer, I feel seen by their humor and surveys. 5. Articulate your inverted audience. Sometimes the details of a well-defined target audience emerge most clearly when describing who you aren't targeting. What consumers would be a bad fit for your brand? Who are you trying to repel? This is also known as a negative persona . Let's look at two contrasting water brands as an example. First up is Boxed Water, which targets consumers who are interested in the environment, wellness, and simplicity. Source Let’s compare Boxed Water to Evian Water. Evian might describe its customers as people who value sports, luxury food, and premium events. Seeing the Instagram feeds side-by-side helps sharpen the qualities that make these brands unique. Source Remember this inverted thinking exercise as we look at examples below. I pulled five real-life target audience examples and included contrasting brands for each one to help make the audience crystal clear.

Download Now Target Audience Examples Let ' s take the concepts we’ve reviewed above and see how they manifest in the examples below. 1. Aldi Aldi is a budget supermarket chain that appeals to practical shoppers who prioritize savings over style. The company ' s approach to audience targeting works because of its focus on the average consumer’s everyday needs. The majority of the store is stocked with staples instead of endless SKUs and brand names. One section of the store (nicknamed the “Aldi finds” section) is stocked with random rotating items that range from underwear to seasonal cookies to dorm room decor. Source Aldi ' s marketing doesn’t make buyers aspire to put together a perfect Instagram-worthy dinner or transform their health. Instead, they lean into budget cooking and life's everyday chaos. Their marketing is relatable and laughs along with viewers, like this post on Threads: Source Who isn't Aldi trying to target? Aesthetic shoppers (like Trader Joe's) or health-first consumers (like Whole Foods). What I like: When Aldi first became popular where I live, it was known as the store with the weird layout and no shopping bags. The company didn't try to blend with the competition: it built a relationship with consumers based on reliable prices and food quality. 2. Duolingo Duolingo is a language learning app that uses humor and pop-culture relevance to appeal to Gen Z and millennial consumers who want to dabble in language learning. Have a look at Duolingo's marketing channels and you may ask yourself “What does any of this have to do with language learning?” The answer: not much . Instead of sharing grammar tips, the marketing focuses on establishing the brand as a piece of pop culture. Language learning is typically rooted in a cultural interest in the language you're learning. But Duolingo understands that casual language learning is a cultural shift in itself, from formal to fun . Source Duolingo's approach to audience targeting works because of its emphasis on progress instead of fluency. Gamification is a key piece of its brand and how it differentiates itself from competitors. Here ' s an example of a viral TikTok video that aligns learning Korean on Duolingo with Netflix’s popular show Squid Game: @duolingo 🌸 KOREAN OR GET EATEN 🌸 on Spotify now - link in bio! #duolingo #netflix #squidgame #squidgame2 ♬ original sound - Duolingo Who isn't Duolingo trying to attract? Serious language learners who want to develop conversation skills (like Rosetta Stone). What I like: As a Duolingo user (currently practicing Dutch), I don't expect to gain language fluency on the app in a few minutes a day. I just enjoy the satisfaction of daily practice, no matter how small. 3. Dunkin' This company‘s understanding of its target audience is apparent even in the name. Dunkin’, previously Dunkin' Donuts, underwent a rebrand in 2018 . It pivoted away from its sugary namesake and embraced what its audience loved most: coffee to help you through the daily grind. Dunkin ' s approach to audience targeting works because they understand how their consumers use their product: Dunkin’ knows that users love grabbing a coffee on their way to work. Source They position themselves as being embedded in customers' busy routines, even with their slogan: “America runs on Dunkin'.” This philosophy oozes out of Dunkin's funny, relatable social media content: Source Who isn't Dunkin' trying to attract? Coffee drinkers who want to get comfy with a cup of specialty coffee in a stylish setting (l",
