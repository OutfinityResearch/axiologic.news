Members Online • EducationalZombie538 New domains redirecting to us Hello! I'm a developer that helps a friend with on-page SEO in his small start up, so in general it's not really my wheelhouse, however I do keep an eye on their domain reputation. I've noticed recently that a large number of new similarly named domains have been purchased and redirected to their site My view on this is that a) search engines will see through it, b) there's no benefit outside of domain squatting as it's not a backlink and is a new domain anyway so has no rep to transfer, and c) it could potentially be seen as a negative. I don't have a paid SEMRush account so can't see the volume that are like this, but from what I can see there are a *lot* of new \"backlinks\", several no longer working, and several from new domains. SEMRush is already noting a high number of links vs traffic Just wanted to check with people with experience that my position is broadly correct before I have a word with them about whoever they've got working on this (if in fact they have) Thanks!

    "essence": "Closing The Digital Performance Gap: Why The C-Suite Must Take Web Effectiveness Seriously When the C-suite ignores web performance, business suffers. Why leadership must own SEO, UX, and strategy to unlock real growth. Bill Hunt 37 seconds ago ⋅ 7 min read Bill Hunt President at Bisan Digital Bio Follow { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Over the years, I&rsquo;ve worked with numerous companies that engaged me to create world-class Search organizations and win the global search game, only to block the majority of the initiatives required to achieve that goal. This disconnect often stems from how the C-suite perceives its website. In too many boardrooms, the site is still seen as a digital brochure and an expense managed by marketing, with limited scrutiny or strategic oversight. Yet, that same site touches nearly every phase of the customer journey, investor perception, partner evaluation, and talent acquisition. In my previous article, &ldquo; Why Your SEO Isn&rsquo;t Working – And It&rsquo;s Not The Team&rsquo;s Fault ,&rdquo; I detailed how structural issues, not underperforming teams, were usually the root cause of poor SEO outcomes. In &ldquo; The New Role Of SEO In The Age Of AI ,&rdquo; I introduced the shift from traditional optimization toward visibility in AI-driven systems. This article brings those ideas together under a single call to action: It&rsquo;s time for executive leadership to own web performance as a measurable, managed business function. What Is The Digital Performance Gap? The Digital Performance Gap is the measurable distance between your online potential and actual business outcomes . Most companies are leaking performance through misaligned teams, disconnected key performance indicators (KPIs), outdated platforms, or siloed operations. Symptoms include: Underwhelming organic traffic and conversions. Disconnected websites across departments or geographies. Content that ranks but doesn&rsquo;t convert (or worse, can&rsquo;t even be found). Slow responsiveness to AI shifts and platform changes. Tools and vendors operating without return on investment (ROI) oversight. In short: You&rsquo;re paying for a Ferrari and driving it like a lawnmower. From Pit Crew To Performance System: A Better Analogy Imagine you&rsquo;re the owner of an F1 racing team. You&rsquo;ve got the budget, the ambition, and a roster of great people – from engineers to mechanics to a world-class driver. However, the engine design was handled by a team that never consulted with the race strategist. Your telemetry data doesn&rsquo;t reach the pit wall. The car is fast in theory, but coordination is poor, and outcomes are inconsistent. Sound familiar? That&rsquo;s how many enterprise websites operate. Everyone is working hard in their silos . But without integrated planning, shared goals, or clear leadership, the system can&rsquo;t perform at its full potential. Web effectiveness isn&rsquo;t just about the &ldquo;driver&rdquo; (e.g., SEO or content teams)—it&rsquo;s about the entire vehicle and how the organization supports it. And the C-suite? They&rsquo;re the race directors. When the director doesn&rsquo;t orchestrate the team, the whole system suffers. In elite racing, the pit crew doesn&rsquo;t just change tires. They analyze data, forecast risks, and adapt in real time. Their split-second coordination with the driver wins races. That&rsquo;s what a web performance system should look like–fully integrated, real-time, and strategically directed. But instead of this synergy, most digital organizations resemble a collection of vendors and internal teams using different playbooks, judged by different KPIs, and waiting for executive direction that never comes. You can&rsquo;t win the race if the engine team is optimizing for safety, the strategist is optimizing for top speed, and the pit crew is trying to meet tire budget KPIs. That&rsquo;s not cross-functional excellence, it&rsquo;s cross-functional chaos. Web Effectiveness Is A Business Metric Web Effectiveness is the degree to which your digital presence delivers against real business goals. It spans: Findability (SEO, search, AI discoverability). Usability (conversion, performance, accessibility). Relevance (structured content that solves user needs). Integration (connected to customer relationship management or CRM, data layers, product feeds). This isn&rsquo;t marketing fluff. It&rsquo;s operational excellence. When no one owns it, everyone loses. IT may control infrastructure. Marketing manages messaging. Sales owns conversion. Legal redlines half the useful copy. But no one owns the outcome. That&rsquo;s a leadership failure. The High Cost Of No Ownership When the C-suite doesn&rsquo;t take web performance seriously, the costs compound: Visibility declines. You&rsquo;re outranked by competitors who understand AI&rsquo;s new rules. Opportunity evaporates. Valuable search terms go unanswered – or worse, answered by the platforms themselves. Budgets get wasted. You pay for tools, agencies, and tech that aren&rsquo;t integrated or even used. Your story gets told by others. Generative engines summarize what they find. If your content isn&rsquo;t structured or visible, you&rsquo;re not even in the conversation. Even companies that only exist online often fail to fully leverage the very platform that drives their value. What Executive Ownership Looks Like Executive ownership doesn&rsquo;t mean micromanaging metadata – it means ensuring that: Web outcomes are tied to business KPIs. Budgeting reflects strategic priority, not departmental silos. SEO, UX, content, and dev teams are operating under a unified model. Vendor evaluations include contribution to visibility and performance. Someone is accountable for closing the performance gap. Consider creating a Web Effectiveness Center of Excellence or appointing a Digital Effectiveness Officer to champion this mandate. A Framework For Closing The Gap To transition from fragmented efforts to strategic impact, organizations require a shared operating model. Here&rsquo;s a high-level Web Effectiveness Framework: Governance: Who owns what? Are responsibilities clear? Visibility: Can search engines and AI systems discover, interpret, and cite your content? Experience: Are you delivering what users need – on every device, in every format? Optimization: Are you using the platforms, features, and data you already pay for? Measurement: Are you tracking impact, not just traffic? This framework can be scaled across divisions, regions, and lines of business. The key is treating your site not as a brochure, but as your most valuable digital asset. Final Thought: Time To Step In Closing the Digital Performance Gap starts with a mindset shift: from cost center to growth platform. From tactical ownership to strategic leadership. Today&rsquo;s website is no longer just a reflection of your brand—it is your brand. It&rsquo;s where customers decide to trust you, where partners evaluate your credibility, and where investors form first impressions. Yet far too often, this central asset is owned by no one, governed by outdated workflows, and limited by KPIs that belong to another era. Let&rsquo;s be clear: digital excellence doesn&rsquo;t happen by accident. It&rsquo;s the result of intentional alignment between leadership, teams, and technology. And that alignment starts with the C-suite. CMOs must champion performance and not just promotion. CTOs must prioritize enablement and not just uptime. CEOs must encourage cross-functional alignment, efficiency, speed, agility, and clarity to ensure optimal performance. Web effectiveness should no longer be framed as a project, initiative, or marketing tactic. It&rsquo;s a performance system. A business function. A shared responsibility. And if you don&rsquo;t have someone responsible for web performance at the leadership level, it&rsquo;s time to create that role. A Digital Effectiveness Officer, a Center of Excellence, or, at a minimum, a cross-functional ownership council that brings visibility, accountability, and forward momentum. Because here&rsquo;s the truth: If you don&rsquo;t own your website&rsquo;s performance, someone else will define your digital reputation—and capture your audience. Bring web effectiveness into the boardroom. Align your teams. Close the gap. More Resources: AI Search Changes Everything – Is Your Organization Built To Compete?

    "essence": "Perplexity’s Discover Pages Offer A Surprising SEO Insight Perplexity's Discover pages are praised as an example of programmatic SEO. In fact, they’re something more ambitious in scope. SEJ STAFF Roger Montti 11 seconds ago ⋅ 5 min read SEJ STAFF Roger Montti Owner - Martinibuster.com at Martinibuster.com Bio Follow { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> A post on LinkedIn called attention to Perplexity&rsquo;s content discovery feed called Discover, which generates content on trending news topics. It praised the feed as a positive example of programmatic SEO, although some said that its days in Google&rsquo;s search results are numbered. Everyone in that discussion believes those pages are one thing. In fact, they are something else entirely. Context: Perplexity Discover Perplexity publishes a Discover feed of trending topics. The page is like a portal to the news of the day, featuring short summaries and links to web pages containing the full summary plus links to the original news reporting. SEOs have noticed that some of those pages are ranking in Google Search, spurring a viral discussion on LinkedIn. Perplexity Discover And Programmatic SEO Programmatic SEO is the use of automation to optimize web content and could also apply to scaled content creation. It can be tricky to pull off well and can result in a poor outcome if not. A LinkedIn post calling attention to the Perplexity AI-generated Discover feed cited it as an example of programmatic SEO &ldquo;on steroids.&rdquo; They wrote: &ldquo;For every trending news topic, it automatically creates a public webpage. These pages are now showing up in Google Search results. When clicked, users land on a summary + can ask follow-up questions in the chatbot. ...This is such a good Programmatic SEO tactic put on steroids!&rdquo; One of the comments in that discussion hailed the Perplexity pages as an example of good programmatic SEO: &ldquo;This is a very bold move by Perplexity. Programmatic SEO at scale, backed by trending topics, is a smart way to capture attention and traffic. The key challenge will be sustainability – Google may see this as thin content or adjust algorithms against it. Still, it shows how AI + SEO is evolving faster than expected.&rdquo; Another person agreed: &ldquo;SEO has been part of their growth strategy since last year, and it works for them quite well&rdquo; The rest of the comments praised Perplexity&rsquo;s SEO as &ldquo;bold&rdquo; and &ldquo;clever&rdquo; as well as providing &ldquo;genuine user value.&rdquo; But there were also some that predicted that &ldquo;Google won&rsquo;t allow this trend...&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Google will nerf it in a few weeks...&rdquo; The overall sentiment of Perplexity&rsquo;s implementation of programmatic SEO was positive. Except that there is no SEO. Perplexity Discover Is Not Programmatic SEO Contrary to what was said in the LinkedIn discussion, Perplexity is not engaging in &ldquo;programmatic SEO,&rdquo; nor are they trying to rank in Google. A peek at the source code of any of the Discover pages shows that the title elements and the meta descriptions are not optimized to rank in search engines. Screenshot Of A Perplexity Discover Web Page Every single page created by Perplexity appears to have the exact same title and meta description elements: <title>Perplexity</title> <meta name=&rdquo;description&rdquo; content=&rdquo;Perplexity is a free AI-powered answer engine that provides accurate, trusted, and real-time answers to any question.&rdquo;/> Every page contains the same canonical tag: <link rel=&rdquo;canonical&rdquo; href=&rdquo; https://www.perplexity.ai &rdquo; /> It&rsquo;s clear that Perplexity&rsquo;s Discover pages are not optimized for Google Search and that the pages are not created for search engines. The pages are created for humans. Given how the Discover pages are not optimized, it&rsquo;s not a surprise that: Every page I tested failed to rank in Google Search. It&rsquo;s clear that Perplexity is engaged in programmatic SEO. Perplexity&rsquo;s Discover pages are not created to rank in Google Search. Perplexity&rsquo;s Discover pages are created specifically for humans. If any pages rank in Google, that&rsquo;s entirely an accident and not by design. What Is Perplexity Actually Doing? Perplexity&rsquo;s Discover pages are examples of something bigger than SEO. They are web pages created for the benefit of users. The fact that no SEO is applied shows that Perplexity is focused on making the Discover pages destinations that users turn to in order to keep in touch with the events of the day. Perplexity Discover is a user-first web destination created with zero SEO, likely because the goals are more ambitious than depending on Google for traffic. The Surprising SEO Insight? It may well be that a good starting point for creating a website and forming a strategy for promoting it lies outside the SEO sandbox. In my experience, I&rsquo;ve had success creating and promoting outside the standard SEO framework, because SEO strategies are inherently limited: they have one goal, ranking, and miss out on activities that create popularity. SEO limits how you can promote a site with arbitrary rules such as: Don&rsquo;t obtain links from sites that nofollow their links. Don&rsquo;t get links from sites that have low popularity. Offline promotion doesn&rsquo;t help your site rank. And here&rsquo;s the thing: promoting a site with strategies focused on building brand name recognition with an audience tends to create the kinds of user behavior signals that we know Google is looking for.

Question Currently running form A/B tests by creating separate ad campaigns (50% traffic to Form A, 50% to Form B) and comparing conversion rates manually. It's working okay, but the process feels clunky, and I am wondering if I am missing something: My current workflow: Create two form versions Set up duplicate ad campaigns with different form links Wait a few weeks, manually pull conversion data from both Try to eyeball if the difference is significant enough to matter Pain points I'm hitting: Traffic never splits exactly 50/50 (one campaign always gets more) Hard to tell when I have enough data to make decisions Takes forever to set up tests for small changes Can only realistically test one thing at a time What I'm curious about: Are there tools that handle the traffic splitting automatically? How do you deal with statistical significance? Just gut feeling? Anyone testing multiple form variations simultaneously? Better ways to track beyond just \"Form A got X%, Form B got Y%\"? I think I am doing this the hard way, and there is probably a more efficient approach I am missing. Would love to hear how others handle this workflow! Read more Share",

This year I hit a wall and what used to inspire me doesn't anymore, and I feel kinda lost, I dont even want to crash out I want to create again, but not just more noise that gets scrolled past. I'm thinking of making a spec brand ad to push myself and to tell better stories that really moves, I read this earlier \"good work informs, great work transforms\" My background is more technical camera + editing but I’ve always struggled with the brand/ideation side. I used to just shoot what was asked, never really thought about how to come up with strong concepts. I want to make something that sticks, and maybe use it as a step to get hired again. I would mainly work on this spec ad using stocks, GenAI, narration, sound design. On a creative ideation stand point, I am still need some learning to do, but I dont want to get stuck on that alone, I want to execute as I go, I am currently in a beginners paralysis. My goal is to get hired even in small projects as a beginner. For the creative people here, do you have any insights on how I can make this work out? Any input, mindset, tips are appreciated.

Question I run marketing in house for a B2B company and our quarters used to yo-yo because campaigns hit hard for a week then quality slid and nobody could explain why. We were chasing channel wins and forgetting the handoff, so sales blamed leads and I blamed timing, then everyone lost confidence since the story kept changing. I rebuilt the basics because I think steady beats shiny. We tied every form and call to the CRM, then we met once a week with one simple scorecard that followed a line from search to meeting and then to revenue. Content moved in step with paid so a topic did not live in ads without a page that could carry it. A colleague pointed me to EWR Digital who talk a lot about growth systems and that nudge helped me join SEO with paid and light automation on the same page rather than three. We still test since curiosity matters, yet we run tests inside one product line first and we keep the scorecard unchanged so we can trust the signal. That rhythm calmed the room because people see the same few numbers and the calendar stops lurching. If you had to pick one habit that cut pipeline whiplash at your company what would you lock in and defend when the quarter gets loud? Read more Share",

    "essence": "Creativity x Culture American Eagle's Latest Celeb Ambassador? Travis Kelce, Taylor Swift's Fiancé Collab with NFL star’s Tru Kolors brand follows buzz around his engagement American Eagle’s CMO said the timely collab with Kelce had been in the works for over a year. American Eagle By Rebecca Stewart --> Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift almost broke the internet on Tuesday, Aug. 26, with their Instagram engagement reveal, featuring a floral photoshoot and a 10-carat ring. With 27 million likes and counting, brands including Krispy Kreme and Walmart have rushed to capitalize on the buzz . Now American Eagle is dropping its own timely collaboration and campaign with the Kansas City Chiefs tight end. Following a partnership with Euphoria actor Sydney Sweeney, the company has launched a 90-piece limited-edition collection with the NFL player’s sportswear and lifestyle brand Tru Kolors, founded in 2019. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) American Eagle chief marketing officer (CMO) Craig Brommers did not confirm whether the brand was given a heads up on the engagement, but told ADWEEK it had been in conversations with Kelce since June 2024. The collection will roll out across two drops on Aug. 27 and Sept. 24, featuring everything from vintage-inspired T-shirts to varsity jackets. Kelce served as a creative director on the project, involved in design, sample selection, and more. Prices run from $14.95 to $179.95. “We had a desire to create a collection that was unique, yet accessible,” said Brommers, adding that “every detail mattered” throughout the design process. The range is backed by a campaign featuring Kelce’s friends and fellow athletes, including rising tennis star Anna Frey, basketball guard Azzi Fudd, and gold medal-winning gymnast Suni Lee. The “AE x Tru Kolors” by Travis Kelce push will run globally across all social platforms. Out-of-home placements will also pop up in the Chiefs’ hometown of Kansas City. The brand is also partnering with NFL news podcast, The Ringer, and running extensive CTV ads. Kelce’s cultural clout This is the latest play from American Eagle to court Gen Z’s dollars by leaning into big moments across sports and culture. In 2024, the brand ran ads around the Super Bowl with athletes including U.S. tennis star Coco Gauff and Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence. In July 2025, it unveiled a new platform, “Live Your Lifebrand,” a fresh take on its longstanding “Live Your Life” slogan with a focus on self-expression and connection. Brommers said Kelce has the “unique ability” to appeal to a Gen Z audience beyond sports, which consistently ranks as a top interest for the company’s target consumers. “He represents the perfect mix of athleticism and cultural relevance that resonates with our consumer,” the marketer said. “I’ve had to keep my excitement about this collab under wraps for nearly a year. It was an awesome opportunity to team up with an established brand where both sides were excited to truly collaborate on every decision in the design and creative process that brought the ‘AE x TK’ collection to life,” said Kelce in a press release. The NFL player added: “I started Tru Kolors in 2019 on the foundation of showing up authentically and having fun with style, and we wanted this collab to reflect that same energy. I want everyone to feel like there is something for them in the collection, something they can feel good in and make their own. I’m excited for it to finally be out in the world.” ‘Swiftynomics’ The campaign will have some heavy lifting to do to help American Eagle turn its finances around. It posted a $68 million adjusted operating loss in the first quarter of 2025, owing to the impact of tariffs, product misses, and a cold spring. When it comes to KPIs from the Kelce partnership, Brommers said American Eagle is currently focused on the two drops, but hopes people are still talking about the campaign in “a year or 20.” He continued: “More importantly, we hope the positive momentum, brand visibility, and deep customer engagement continue as we position American Eagle at the center of culture for many years to come.” American Eagle has always featured celebrity endorsements, but this year it’s gone harder on deals with trending talent, including Sweeney, and another with the cast of buzzy Prime Video series The Summer I Turned Pretty . “We don’t want to just work with talent that reflects culture; we want to work with them to define it,” said Brommers. The launch also comes as brands race to capitalize on the cultural halo effect of Swift, whose influence on consumer behavior has been dubbed “Swiftynomics.” The Marketer’s Guide to Taylor Swift’s Life of a Showgirl Era From NFL ticket and ad sales to brands like Panera and Reese’s jumping on the buzz around her recent Life of a Showgirl album reveal on the Kelce brothers’ New Heights podcast, Swift’s ability to drive demand extends well beyond music. Her dedicated fans, dubbed Swifties, spent approximately $5 billion in U.S. destinations during her 2023/24 Eras Tour, according to the U.S. Travel Association. When indirect spending was factored in, this number exceeded $10 billion.

    "essence": "Adspeak Criteo vs. the Upstarts: A Retail Media Showdown The retail media gold rush is getting crowded, and Criteo’s position is being tested ADWEEK By Ryan Joe --> Retail (or commerce) media has been one of the most promising growth areas in digital advertising over the last few years. But you can’t have gold without a rush—and in this case, its a rush of retailers trying to become ad networks, and a rush of vendors with all the tools to help them power up. If there’s one adtech company that’s long been associated with retail, it’s Criteo. It got its start as a retargeting firm, and benefited from the retail media boom. But lately a bunch of upstarts have emerged, claiming to offer better tech at cheaper prices. Criteo has also suffered attrition, as clients like Uber Eats and Target’s Roundel have rolled back their relationship with the public company. But Criteo has held steady so far despite these headwinds. In this episode of Adspeak, retail and commerce editor Kathryn Lundstrom looks at how Criteo has managed to hold up amidst a sea of upstart competition—for now. With many RFPs still undecided, September will be a major moment for the company. And of course, Criteo continues to fight a two-front war. Besides a handful of new companies nipping at its heels, it still has to contend with Amazon, the ecommerce giant that’s also releasing new products that seem to take aim at one of Criteo’s core value props: helping companies build their own retail media networks.

    "essence": "Branding Meet the Brands Partnering With The Summer I Turned Pretty to Reach Gen Z Sour Patch Kids and Catbird are collaborating with the show Brands are backing Amazon Prime's The Summer I Turned Pretty. Amazon By Elena Cavender --> Amazon Prime Video’s The Summer I Turned Pretty’s final season is well underway, and brands are eager to reach the show’s fans. The third season of the show debuted on July 16 with two episodes, receiving 25 million viewers globally in the first week, according to Amazon . That’s a 40% increase in viewership compared to the second season’s performance in the same time period. Additionally, the show’s viewership tripled from Season 1 to Season 3 in the first seven days. As the show’s popularity has grown as the series comes to an end, Amazon snagged deals with brands including Catbird jewelry, apparel brand Solid & Striped, and Sour Patch Kids that go beyond product placement. ADWEEK rounded up the brands featured in the third season of The Summer I Turned Pretty. Catbird Jewelry brand Catbird scored an integration into one of the most talked about moments of the show: Jeremiah’s proposal to Belly in the second episode. Jeremiah proposes with Catbird’s dainty Diamond Fizz Ring, which generated lots of online chatter about its slight size. Leigh Plessner, Catbird’s chief creative officer, told ADWEEK that the brand knew that the ring was going to be used in the show, but seeing how it was used and received by audiences was a fun moment. Within a month of the episode airing, Catbird saw a 1,900% increase in pageviews for the ring on the brand’s ecommerce site, according to Catbird. Belly also wears Catbird’s 100 Summers Gold Chain with a daisy charm in the show. The partnership between Catbird and The Summer I Turned Pretty came about after Opening Ceremony cofounder and the show’s stylist Carol Lim DMed Plessner’s personal Instagram account. They then created a seven-piece jewelry collection that’s available on Catbird’s website. It includes a gold bracelet that reads Belly as well as a shell charm. Catbird has collaborated with Phoebe Bridgers, Laufey, Jenny Slate, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the past. The goal is for partnerships to come from a place of real connection to the collaborative project, said Plessner. For The Summer I Turned Pretty, Plessner felt that jewelry was a big part of the show’s story and of Belly’s style evolution. “Something that’s really special about the show is that even though the main characters are of a certain age, the fan base is across generation and gender,” said Plessner. “While the theory of reaching young people is true, there’s so much more to it.” Sour Patch Kids Still, the show heavily skews towards Gen Z and teens—a core demographic that Sour Patch Kids uses to vet its partnerships, said John Vasington, senior brand manager of candy at Mondelez International. “To have a show that’s so popular amongst that audience—and so naturally integrates our brands in a way that feels really resonant—had us very excited to make things official and become official partners for season three,” said Vasington. Sour Patch Kids and Swedish Fish—both owned by Mondelez International—were organically included in the second season of the show when Conrad buys Belly Sour Patch Kids while Jeremiah buys her Swedish Fish. “Each brother and their storyline up to that point in Season 2 really aligned with the brands and the storytelling there,” said Vasington. He pointed to Jeremiah’s sweetness fitting with Swedish Fish. Conrad is more reserved before opening up embodying the sour then sweet taste of Sour Patch Kids. For Season 3, Mondelez released exclusive Team Conrad and Team Jeremiah packs of Sour Patch Kids and Swedish Fish and watch party snack mixes. Ten thousand of the Team Conrad and Team Jeremiah packs were made to sell on Amazon. The packs are also for sale on teen-centric retailer IT’SUGAR. A handful of retailers including Krogers and Albertsons also received in-store displays featuring the Conrad and Jeremiah characters. Solid & Striped Solid & Striped’s integration into the third season of the show came from being organically part of the first season of the show when Belly wears two of the brand’s swimsuits. For Season 3, the apparel brand built a capsule collection with Lim. It’s the first time that Solid & Striped has done a brand integration and it felt like a natural fit for the brand, Ginger Lau, Solid & Striped’s design director, told ADWEEK. “We chose to do it because Belly already wore Solid & Striped before we formalized the partnership,” said Lau. “We made sure that the pieces weren’t just placed, but felt like part of the storytelling.” Solid & Striped’s products are available on the brand’s ecommerce site and on Amazon. On social media, Solid & Striped noticed a surge in engagement about the show, especially among younger audiences, said Michelle Guiles, the brand’s COO. The collaboration drove 2.5 times higher engagement than the brand’s average social posts with notable increases in reach and follower count. Coach Coach is also featured in the show, and is running traditional ads during breaks on the ad-supported tier of Prime Video. The fashion brand also created a capsule line of bags inspired by the show. The collection of 21 pieces includes bag charms, a backpack, and quilted purses. Coach sold the products on its own ecommerce site as well as Amazon—although the collection is currently sold out on Amazon. “It felt like a natural fit for Coach and Coachtopia because of the way the show’s themes of youth, transformation and self-discovery align with our brand values,” said Jennifer Yue, svp of strategy and consumer insights at Tapestry and Coach. “Our integration into the show has allowed us to be part of the story and create a cultural moment that resonates with Gen Z.” Elena Cavender Elena Cavender is ADWEEK's influencer marketing reporter based out of New York City.

    "essence": "Brands Blue Apron Pioneered Meal-Kit Subscriptions. Here's Why It's Scrapping Them Three dystopian spots mark the end of Blue Apron’s subscription era Blue Apron helped introduce America to meal kits in 2012, but today's it's playing in a crowded category. Blue Apron By Robert Klara --> Earlier this year, The Hollywood Reporter asked Charlie Brooker, creator of Netflix’s anthology series Black Mirror , how he can take almost any topic to a dark and dystopian place. Brooker admitted to having “a lot of neuroses and worrying about horrible but logical consequences. I can’t look at anything without thinking, ‘How could that hurt me?’” he said. Thus far, the long-running series hasn’t taken on the topic of home meal kits—but maybe it should. Next week, Blue Apron will begin airing three spots that head of marketing Raina Enand is first to say are distinctively Black Mirror-like. “Hopefully when you watch it,” she said, “it should look like something that you would not expect from Blue Apron.” And you probably wouldn’t. That’s because the characters in these spots are trapped in a nightmare realm controlled by nefarious subscription plans—which have been Blue Apron’s revenue model since its 2012 founding. But now that model is gone, replaced by à la carte ordering. The three ads—the final piece of a comprehensive brand overhaul—follow a similar story line. They open with people trapped in a gray, Orwellian world where it’s impossible to do anything from unfasten a seatbelt to get a beverage from a vending machine without committing to prepayment. “We turned subscription fatigue into a dystopian fever dream,” said Angela Campos, creative and commercial director of Quirk, the agency behind the work. “Trust me, it’s a lot more fun to watch than to live through.” These slate gray visions give way to a happier, freer world where purchase flexibility and consumer autonomy have returned. “Somewhere along the way, you had to subscribe to everything—even dinner,” intones a narrator in one spot. “With the new Blue Apron, you don’t.” The video segments alone are an ambitious effort: three 30-second ads with six 15-second cuts; a 15-second homepage app video; a 16-minute video; 10 videos for social media; and seven audio versions. But one question looms behind all of it: why is Blue Apron scuttling its revenue model in the first place? From meal kits to á la carte Because times change. England said that the fast-paced life that made meal subscriptions look like a good solution a decade ago has now grown so hectic that subscriptions feel confining and out of date. “Life is really different now,” she said. “Busy families need more control and flexibility.” Committing to a weekly meal plan, she added, is “just not how people eat food.” To increase flexibility, Blue Apron has doubled its menu offerings to 100 and added two new kinds of kits. Assemble & Bake is aimed at families and can be prepared in 10 minutes, while Dish is a single-serve meal that comes ready to put into the oven. Those who still prefer the subscription option will enjoy rewards such as Blue Apron+, which offers perks like free delivery and Auto Ship and Save, which lets customers dial their delivery frequency anywhere from weekly to just one week a month. The other reason Blue Apron is changing its business model is more systemic: the company has needed a major overhaul for years. Wonder Group bought Blue Apron in 2023 for $103 million, a shadow of the $1.9 billion valuation Wall Street gave it after its 2017 IPO. But operational complexities, high marketing costs, and increased competition caused the brand to slip from those heights almost immediately. By the end of 2017, Blue Apron’s net losses tallied to $210 million, while its customer count shrank by 15%. In fact, high customer attrition rates assail the whole meal-kit industry , a love-’em-and-leave-’em world in which customers pivot among introductory offers instead of staying loyal to one service. Research conducted by the Wall Street Journal in 2023 showed that a staggering 90% of customers for the five leading meal-kit brands abandoned their memberships within a year of signing up. A hill to climb As part of the brand relaunch, Blue Apron has also reworked its website, toning down the blues in favor of ochre and flax “to make the food the star of the show,” Enand said. Food photography has also changed to “look like a plate on a countertop in your home—it should feel identifiable with your life.” Yet even if all the new tweaks resonate with customers, category leader Hello Fresh still commands some 75% of the market—leaving open the question of whether these efforts, calculated as they are, will deliver the needed results. Digital transformation authority Craig Miller, author of Bricks and Clicks: How We Drove Sonic into the Digital Age, believes the revenue model shift will help Blue Apron reclaim some market share, “but would most likely be a short-term win and difficult to sustain.” “The tradeoffs and drawbacks for a no-commitment model may more than offset the benefits,” Miller continued. “An increase in operational complexity in their supply chain will continue to put a strain on their customer service levels and overall profitability.” Meal Kits Had Their Chance. Covid-19 Has Given Them Another One But Enand remains confident that the hard work will pay off. “We’ve been working on this for the past year, listening to customer feedback on what the market is moving towards, and we really thought about this as all encompassing from every aspect of the business,” she said. “Calling it a rebrand is actually doing it a disservice. It’s really a relaunch of the company.” Robert Klara Robert Klara is the senior editor of brands at Adweek, specializing in the evolution and impact of brands. @UpperEastRob | robert.klara@adweek.com Recommended videos The Latest Newsletters ADWEEK Daily Start your morning right with a round-up of first-look news and sharp analysis you won't find elsewhere.

Neon’s new body horror film, Together, premiered at the end of July and has amassed nearly $28 million at the global box office (on a budget of $17 million), debuting to $10.9 million domestically . Before that, it made its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and screened at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas, in March, receiving critical praise. Directed by Michael Shanks, the film stars Brie and Franco as a couple in a long-term relationship who move to the suburbs when strange occurrences begin to happen that fuse them together. And to promote the film, the indie distributor ran an extensive—and absurd—marketing campaign, featuring a mix of digital and real-life stunts. Part of the campaign’s success stemmed from the stars’ complete buy-in, with Brie and Franco, who are married, working in tandem with the marketing team and Shanks on the rollout. “We must have thrown 40 ideas at them and they said yes to probably 38,” Christian Parkes, chief marketing officer at Neon, said. “Within that, we got a tighter group of the things that we felt would resonate most in the campaign. While we’re pitching them ideas, they’re building on those ideas. It’s rare that it works in a way that Together did, but this was truly collaborative with Shanks, Dave, and Alison.” Among the highlights, the Neon social accounts leaned into showcasing celebrity couples and sharing images of fans taking pictures in front of a billboard featuring Brie and Franco. Meanwhile, the pair put in the legwork, attending various events, screenings, and pop-up shops. Some of the specific moments include Brie and Franco attending a New York Yankees game together, where they put on a double-headed hoodie and threw out the first pitch at the start of the game. Other moments came from the couple going on “paparazzi walks” that captured them in bizarre “codependent and vulnerable moments,” with Brie clipping Franco’s toenails in Chicago’s Griffith Park or Franco drinking a towel soaked with Brie’s sweat after a workout. “Dave and Alison just jumped in. They were all in and couldn’t have been better to work with,” Parkes said. “What that does is it just inspires you to push harder and to do better work because they’re giving you the permission.” How These 7 Horror Films Pushed the Boundaries of Movie Marketing Brie and Franco weren’t the only ones going above and beyond, as Neon brought in new technology, hosting a “pupil dilation screening” in Los Angeles to examine people’s eyes while they watched the movie. The tech came from a Singapore-based company, and the screening was the first time it was tested live, according to Parkes. Neon also flew in the team from Singapore and cameras from Germany to make the stunt happen. “It was terrifying for us because it was a huge effort to pull it all together and to make it work—and obviously a great expense,” Parkes said. “It was almost like live TV. We didn’t know if this thing would actually work, but obviously it did because those pupils were just exploding.” Some of the other themed screenings included a partnership with OurRitual , as well as a “buy one, get one free” ticket promotion. “These things are informed by the film and taking the theme as a root of inspiration: bringing people together,” Parkes said. “If couples are apart, and it’s because of us, we’ll bring them back together. As messed up as Together is, it’s ultimately a love story. We could all have a little bit of that right now.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by NEON (@neonrated) How to sell a pop-up shop Another part of the campaign featured pop-up shops with exclusive merch and Brie and Franco in attendance. According to Parkes, thousands of fans showed up waiting in line for hours. The limited-edition merch included a body saw, hair floss, the joint hoodie Brie and Franco wore to the Yankees game, a sculpted finger bowl, and conventional items such as vinyl records and t-shirts. There were also things like rat king-shaped air fresheners that Parkes said were intentionally made to smell bad. “The exciting stuff lives on the fringes,” Parkes said. “It lives on the edges. It doesn’t live in the middle. The middle is inherently boring for us. We like to live on the outside a little bit. That’s where things get more interesting, and, ultimately, that’s what audiences want.” Saleah Blancaflor Saleah Blancaflor is a TV reporter at ADWEEK. @saleyley | saleah.blancaflor@adweek.com Recommended videos The Latest Newsletters ADWEEK Daily Start your morning right with a round-up of first-look news and sharp analysis you won't find elsewhere.

    "essence": "Creativity x Culture At Bad Bunny's Sold-Out Puerto Rico Residency, Brands Score a Front-Row Seat Ritz Crackers, Method, and more are courting Latino fans through experiences in and around the event ADWEEK; Mike Coppola/Getty Images By Cydney Lee --> Bad Bunny has been booked and busy in 2025. From releasing his sixth album , hosting Saturday Night Live , announcing a world tour , and starring in Ritz’s first Super Bowl commercial , the Puerto Rican artist has been everywhere. However, a milestone of his year (and career) has been No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí (I Don’t Want to Leave From Here), his first-of-its-kind, sold-out homecoming residency running every weekend from July 11 to September 14 at Coliseo de Puerto Rico. While tickets for the first nine shows were reserved exclusively for island residents, Discover Puerto Rico —the island’s official tourism guide—partnered with Live Nation-owned travel platform Vibee to sell curated vacation packages for the residency, which are expected to generate nearly $200 million in economic impact. “That’s extremely conservative because that’s only taking into consideration those packages,” Glorianna Yamin, Discover Puerto Rico’s vp of marketing, told ADWEEK. He said the board expects to have an all-encompassing figure, including visitors who stayed at external hotels and rentals, once the residency concludes. “[Vibee] sold 48,000 room nights [across] 34 properties,” she continued. “Not only the metro region where the concert is taking place, but around the entire island.” In addition to Discover Puerto Rico, which has leveraged the summer event by marketing other hotspots around the island, brands including Ritz Crackers, Method, Vibee, Wendy’s , and JetBlue are all capitalizing on the influx of concertgoers through fan giveaways and on-site experiences. Adidas Originals also released a sneaker in collaboration with the musician, who has served as one of its brand ambassadors since 2021. No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí has delivered organic boosts for brands like Tinder, which has seen a 35% increase in swipe activity in Puerto Rico and a nearly 52% increase in Passport Mode activity (a feature that allows users to change their location) to San Juan, P.R., since July. An homage to Puerto Rico For Miguel Lopez-Ixta, head of brand and growth at creative agency Need Pastel, which previously collaborated with the musician on merch designs for Bad Bunny’s past tours, the musician’s residency underscores the significance of Latin-American buying power. According to the 2025 U.S. Latino GDP Report , the total economic output of Latinos in the U.S. reached a record $4.1 trillion in 2023, up from $3.7 trillion in 2022. “At the end of the day, the whole residency was for Puerto Rico,” he said. “There’s a ton of local businesses, and that was the goal: to make sure they benefit. So if you’re a brand, you have to think about that too.” He continued: “It doesn’t matter how big a brand you are, you have the opportunity to show up authentically and not just talk to this [community], but build with [them]. If you look at the brands that did, they worked to make sure that they were paying homage to Puerto Rico, one way or another.” Bad Bunny’s Love Letter to Puerto Rico Earns His Label a Cannes Lions Grand Prix Boricua fan experiences While No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí is a moment in and of itself, additional fan experiences have surrounded the main attraction, courtesy of brand sponsors like Vibee, Ritz, and Method. Vibee partnered with Bad Bunny’s label, Rimas Entertainment, and local creative agency, Upside Down, for Seguimo’ Aquí: The Experience by Vibee, its “largest single-location hotel partnership to date,” president Harvey Cohen told ADWEEK. The immersive, multi-sensory experience resembles a traditional Puerto Rican home and garden, with additional touchpoints such as: a cave installation inspired by the local legend of El Pozo de Jacinto, a bar modeled after the central plaza found in many Puerto Rican towns, and VIP gifting kits. “The Latin community represents one of the most passionate and engaged fan bases in the world,” Vibee’s president, Harvey Cohen, told ADWEEK. “For Vibee, it’s important to honor that cultural richness by creating experiences that feel localized and celebratory.” Seguimo’ Aqu&iacute;: The Experience by Vibee. Vibee Similarly, as the official snacking sponsor of the residency, Ritz brought its “Salty Club” to life earlier this month with a pop-up activation equipped with a photo booth and exclusive merch like a limited-edition Ritz Crackers box featuring artwork nodding to the event. The Mondelēz International brand first debuted the “Salty Club” in its first Super Bowl spot featuring Bad Bunny earlier this year. For the residency, it also held a giveaway leading up to its August activation, offering fans a chance to score tickets to the show with all travel and accommodation costs paid for. Steven Saenen, Mondelēz’s U.S. savory snacking category president, told ADWEEK that the Latino community is Ritz’s top multicultural audience. He also shared that the initial partnership with Bad Bunny came naturally since the musician is “genuinely a fan” of the brand. “It’s important to us because we already have a lot of strength with that cohort [and] we want to keep that going because it’s also a demographic that’s growing,” the exec said. “We have deliberate efforts to continue to engage with them and create meaningful connections. One other example is [our] new partnership with Inter Miami this year.” Ritz’s Salty Club Ritz Meanwhile, Method established a presence in a more unexpected yet high-traffic location within the venue: the restrooms. The personal care brand decked out restrooms across the venue for a campaign called “ Pa’l Recuerdo ,” (or “a souvenir ,”) which was “designed to transform everyday routines into rich, sensory experiences that honor culture and create space for presence,” the brand told ADWEEK in a statement. Pa’l recuerdo is reflective of the “beauty and vibrancy of Puerto Rican culture,” housing exclusive gifts and merchandise, such as a limited-edition body wash and a waterproof speaker for guests to enjoy beyond the experience. Per the brand’s internal research, 75% of Latino consumers said that music is a key part of their shower ritual. As the residency’s official body wash and hand wash sponsor, Method’s goal was to create an emotional connection with existing and potential Latino consumers, a demographic that overindexes on its personal care products. method’s pa’l recuerdo method No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí marks the second music event Method has sponsored. For the past two years, it has also been the official body and hair care partner of Coachella . Beyond Puerto Rico Following No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí, Bad Bunny will embark on his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour , starting November 21 and ending July 22, 2026. While Method plans to bring pa’l recuerdo to fans at his London stops, Saenen remained tight-lipped on whether Ritz will activate around the tour or not. “Latinos are so loyal to brands and the things [we] believe in, and I think in the long run [brands] showing up and continuing to show up are going to be affiliated with this community and [we’re] going to rock with you,” said Lopez-Ixta.

Members Online • emojidomain How Coca-Cola turned $3,000 into $1,000,000 in free publicity (and what startups can learn from emoji domains) Most founders think they need big budgets to make noise. But sometimes, the scrappiest stunts create the biggest waves. Case 1: Coca-Cola’s $3K → $1M billboard 2015, Puerto Rico. Coca-Cola registered a few emoji domains under .ws. They spent $3,000 on a billboard that just showed: their logo a giant (😀.ws) No slogan. No CTA. Nothing else. People pulled out their phones, typed it in, and shared it. Local and national media picked it up. The ROI? Spend → $3,000 Earned media → $1,000,000+ in equivalent coverage Case 2: (👁️👄👁️.fm) raises $200K 2020: A collective launched 👁️👄👁️.fm. Twitter went wild thinking it was a secret invite-only app. Thousands posted the domain just to look “in the know.” The twist? It was actually a stunt to raise money for social justice. Result: $200,000 raised in days + coverage in Wired, Forbes, The Verge, Gizmodo, etc. Case 3: Nike’s 🏀.to: Even Nike uses emoji domains. 🏀.to redirects straight to nike.com/basketball. That’s a Fortune 500 brand quietly validating emoji domains as short, visual, memorable links, basically logos built into URLs. Why it matters for startups Novelty is leverage. Most people still haven’t seen emoji domains, which makes them scroll-stopping. Scrappy can beat spendy. Coca-Cola proved you don’t need millions to grab attention. Storytelling matters. 👁️👄👁️ dot fm worked because people wanted to share it.

ADWEEK By Cydney Lee --> Two weeks after announcing her 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl , Taylor Swift is now engaged. The singer announced the news on Instagram on Tuesday, Aug. 26, sharing photos of her and her now-fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, posing in a floral garden. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” she wrote. Naturally, the proposal sent the internet into a frenzy, with 27 million likes and counting on the original post. As ever, brands were quick to react to the moment, too, claiming dibs on their involvement in the wedding and using it as a marketing opportunity. The buzz follows campaigns from Panera and Reese’s last week, which were tied to the singer’s upcoming album. “Successful reactive marketing isn’t about jumping on every trend; it’s about participating in the right moments,” Miruna Dragomir, chief marketing officer (CMO) at content collaboration platform Planable, told ADWEEK. “Brands that avoid these pitfalls and maintain methodical approaches are creating long-term competitive advantages.” Following Kelce’s proposal, ADWEEK has rounded up some of the best brand reactions.

Stein wrote on X that Google has been testing where links appear inside AI answers and that the long-term &ldquo;north star&rdquo; is to show more inline links. He added that people are more likely to click when links are embedded with context directly in the response. Stein stated: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been experimenting with how and where to show links in ways that are most helpful to users and sites... our long term north star is to show more inline links.&rdquo; 1/ Excited about the work the team is doing to create AI experiences in Search that highlight useful links and encourage onward exploration. We&rsquo;ve been experimenting with how and where to show links in ways that are most helpful to users and sites, and you&rsquo;ll be seeing some of... — Robby Stein (@rmstein) August 25, 2025 What&rsquo;s Changing Link Carousels On Desktop. Google has launched carousels that surface multiple source links directly inside AI Mode responses on desktop. Stein said mobile support is coming soon. The idea is to present links with enough context to help people decide where to go next without hunting below the answer. 2/ We&rsquo;ve found that people really prefer and are more likely to click links that are embedded within AI Mode responses, when they have more context on what they&rsquo;re clicking and where they want to dig deeper. We&rsquo;ve launched embedded link carousels in AI Mode responses on desktop,... — Robby Stein (@rmstein) August 25, 2025 Smarter Inline Links Google is rolling out model updates that decide where inline links appear within the response text. The system is trained to place links at moments when people are most likely to click out to see where information came from or to learn more. Stein noted you might see fluctuations over the next few weeks as this is deployed, with a longer-term push toward more inline links overall. 3/ We&rsquo;re also launching some model updates to improve how we show inline links (links that are embedded directly within text) in AI Mode responses. We train the model to understand where and when people are most likely to want to click out, see where info is coming from and learn... — Robby Stein (@rmstein) August 25, 2025 Web Guide Separately, Google&rsquo;s Web Guide experiment uses a custom Gemini model to group useful links by topic. It launched in Search Labs on the &ldquo;Web&rdquo; tab and, for opted-in users, will begin appearing on the main &ldquo;All&rdquo; tab when systems determine it could help for a query. Google introduced Web Guide in July and indicated it would expand beyond the Web tab over time. 4/ We&rsquo;re also expanding our Web Guide experiment in Labs, which is a new approach to intelligently surfacing and organizing the most useful web links with AI – even for your hardest queries. We&rsquo;ve gotten some really positive feedback as we&rsquo;ve tested this on the &ldquo;Web&rdquo; tab. So in... — Robby Stein (@rmstein) August 25, 2025 Why It Matters How Google presents links in AI Mode can influence how people reach your site. Placing carousels within the answer and adjusting inline placements differ from links that appear only below the response. This may change click behavior depending on the query and presentation. Looking Ahead Google is trying to strike a balance between innovation and supporting publishers. Expect continued testing around link density, placement, and labeling as Google refines AI mode.

Members Online • _BenRichards SEO impact for large website using CSR I have a potential client in the environmental sector sector who operates a large web property (over 2M pages) that they want to replatform. The current site is built on a dead stack and they’re wanting to move to React/Next/GraphQL due to security, client-side performance and scaling problems. Because they’re a nonprofit the budget is tight, and data is constantly changing for their node locations; so pre-rendering is off the table. SSR is problematic due to their current hardware to which there is limited budget for improve (so my guess is that won’t happen). The CTO is wanting to only CSR then front everything via CDN. While this should be fine for researchers I’m fairly certain this will tank their SEO. I’m able to call a lot of this out in my contract, but being a huge fan of CYA, does anyone know the time delta from when the initial DOM structure gets indexed by Google, then JS rendering crawlers will parse the page , then the rendered data gets scored and shows up in SERP so I can call that out? Also a gut check on the processing flow would be helpful. Read more Share",

Members Online • TrapsAreNotGay69 Question on Expired Domain Authority Help I wanted to ask about purchasing expired domains as I'm considering building my own PBN for private use on my website. I know we're supposed to look at authority, but I'm seeing large discrepancies between Semrush AS and Ahrefs DR. Like there was a domain with 5 AS but 52 DR. I noticed that under the AS, Semrush will explicitly say that the domain lacks organic traffic but has a strong backlink profile, is this the reason? If it helps, I saw that the Moz DA was 19 and PA was 41. Also, where does Spam Score come into play for these domains, should I value it as an important indicator? From my research this specific domain looks clean but I've also heard that there is an Expired Domain Abuse Penalty from Google so I was wondering if this strategy is still viable as well.

    "essence": "Home Marketing Don't just grow to grow: Real talk from a serial founder Don't just grow to grow: Real talk from a serial founder Written by: Curt del Principe MASTERS IN MARKETING No fluff, only first-hand expert advice and curated marketing trends from across the web. Subscribe Now Updated: 08/27/25 There are some lessons you only learn when life hits you hard. This week’s master stared down the loss of his business — “All of Q4 was the biggest punch in the face for me that year. It was the most stressed I’ve ever been in my life.” — and came out the other side with a six-figure agency. Today, he shares the kind of vulnerability and real talk you rarely get from entrepreneurs. And his advice just might help you duck a punch. Ryan Atkinson Founder and CEO at Spacebar Visuals ; Host of The UpFlip Podcast Fun fact: In business school, Ryan got the lowest grade in a class called Founders Club. He went on to grow his own six-figure business. Claim to fame: Named to Austin’s 25 Under 25 and the Tippie Young Alumni Board. His podcast about entrepreneurship has hit over 2 million downloads. Lesson 1: Don’t just grow to grow. If you believe the hustle-culture hype that thrives on LinkedIn, the only way to get ahead is to eat and breathe the grind, right? I’d say “eat, sleep, and breathe,” but the grind never sleeps. “I thought when I [created] Spacebar, I wanted to grow as much as possible, hire as much as possible,” Ryan Atkinson says. And his business did grow — second only to his stress levels. “This is probably TMI, but I had canker sores from stress. I couldn’t even listen to music, because music would make me anxious,” he confesses. Atkinson reached a point where he had to reevaluate both his business and life goals and consider what he was growing toward. (Something that many entrepreneurs won’t admit.) His advice to you solopreneurs, startup founders, and small business owners? “ The goal is still growth, but it’s not growth at all costs. Grow to hire correctly. Grow profitably. Grow mindfully.” Lesson 2: It’s okay to start cheap. Video is no longer a nice-to-have for marketers, but that doesn’t mean you have to drop half your net worth making the next Marvel movie. “Let's say you're a startup company, where you have a limited budget. You can't spend 20 grand on a video. Honestly, Upwork is a great place to get started. ” I took a sip of my tea just so I could do a spit-take. The solution isn’t to write a check to his video agency? “It doesn’t have to be Spacebar,” Atkinson laughs. “But you can’t do an iPhone type of video if you want to make a good first impression on prospects.” “If you’re a startup marketer, you have 1,000 things you need to be doing. You have reporting. You have campaigns. You have email marketing. And video is not easy to get right. So, go to Upwork, find someone that can do it for $500, $900.” To be clear, he’s not talking about dropping that cash on run-of-the-mill TikTok posts. This is about investing in videos that meet your audience at key steps on their buyer’s journey. “You want to have a top-of-funnel explainer video because people need to know who you are. You want a brand overview video. And you want a product demo that brings your product to life. If you could only do three assets with video, do those. ” Atkinson went on to break down exact recommendations for each of those videos, but since I couldn’t squeeze ’em into one newsletter, I’ve linked a longer guide down below. Lesson 3: Podcast for a different purpose. As a fractional podcast host, Atkinson has helped launch more podcasts than most people have consumed. So I asked him the key to getting a successful show up and running. “Growing a podcast is incredibly hard. It’s almost impossible to do it independently now,” he admits. “ I love podcasting so much, but the more I get into it, the more I’m realizing it truly is pay-to-play. ” Atkinson explains that unless you can pay for broad distribution, or unless you’ve got a ready-made audience — say on LinkedIn or in a newsletter — it’s unlikely you’ll grow to a point where monetizing your podcast is worth the time you put in it. But even if you’re never a top 100 podcast in your niche, there are other reasons to do it. “Podcasts can be reused as a blog post, email, [or] for SEO.” Not to mention repurposed for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn. So even if the podcast itself is slow to gain traction, the effort can pay out in cross-functional content. And your show can even be an icebreaker for those hard-to-reach clients: “We use it sometimes to let us talk with prospects and get introduced to them. Reach out to your [ideal customer profile] like, ‘Hey, you want to be a guest on our podcast?’” Once you interview them, it opens the door to further collaboration and conversation. Just “don’t think you’ll be a top 50, even top 100 podcast in two weeks.” Lingering Questions This Week’s Question “What sparks joy for you?” — Jayde Powell, Founder and head of creative, The Em Dash Co. This Week’s Answer Atkinson says: “Professionally, when you take a bet on something and it works. Personally, being with family, friends, working out, and reading books.” Next Week’s Question Atkinson asks: “ If you could only invest in one tool to help your company grow for the next three years, what tool would it be? ” Don't forget to share this post!",

Members Online • awholenoobworld anyone have experience w/ TikTok location based ads? This is for a local business (pub + nightclub) in a non-tourist area, so we're only interested in targeting people in this zip code and the surrounding ones. Running Meta (instagram + facebook) ads used to get some traction, but we're not getting clicks or reactions anymore. It's a college town, so I've considered paid advertising on TikTok (we have no other reason to start a TikTok account because there aren't enough users in our rural area, and nobody anywhere else cares what bands or DJs are playing in this town - similarly, I hate that our Instagram reels about our daily food specials and events are mostly shown to people in other countries, instead of our followers). Anyways, just sort of flailing here with the constant algorithm changes and trying to remind / let new locals know we exist... Is TikTok useless in this situation, or worth paying for ads? Edit to add: Wow, is it really $20 per day minimum, or is there a different way to set it up? It's such a small percentage of the population using TikTok here, and some of them aren't old enough to drink in bars yet, so maybe not the best option for us, being in a rural area where people aren't super tech savvy...

Members Online • Napoleon_dominator Looking for path to practise SEO Hey, I'm from Poland and I recently completed a comprehensive SEO course. I learned a lot from it, but it's only theoretical knowledge. I'm very interested in SEO and I would like to develop my skills in it, but unfortunately my resume isn't getting any responses. So I decided to gain some practical experience on my own, and I'd like to ask you for some advice. What is the best way to gain such experience on my own? I don't want to take on clients as a freelancer without experience. I would like to create my own project that will be able to generate some income. I was thinking about a blog - it seems like the simplest option, but can it be monetized? I was thinking most about an online store. Can you recommend any niches, perhaps from your country, that don't have as much competition as, for example, insurance, and would be good for practice at the beginning? I was thinking about a birthday gift store or an ebook about overcoming addiction. Is there any other way to gain experience on my own that you would recommend? Read more Share",

Hey everyone, My small business (small town accounting firm...with big dreams!) recently got a new website. After years of paying an SEO guy (to do who knows what) and writing okay-ish blogs whenever I had time, we're left with a bunch of articles that are very spam-y. Titles like: How to Hire Small Town Accountant in Your Area How a Small Business Accountant Can Help Your Business and others like that, you've read a million of them My question is: should I delete all these old bad blog posts and begin anew with a new, more comprehensive and much better blog content plan? I plan to (and have been trying to) write long articles that are actually factual, helpful, and address real issues in my industry. I plan to do this either, way but I just want to know if I should delete all the old posts? Or will that tank us on Google? TYIA!!!! Read more Share",

    "essence": "Go to digital_marketing r/digital_marketing • hibuhelps How do you balance promotional vs. educational content? Hey y’all! We’re curious how you all approach the content mix when marketing for clients or your own biz. Like, we all know posting only promotional stuff feels spammy and usually gets ignored. But at the same time, going 100% educational can make people forget you actually offer something. In our experience working with local businesses, the sweet spot seems to be a mix … for example, 70% helpful/educational and 30% light promotion sprinkled in. But even then, what “educational” means really depends on the audience. For a dentist, it could be tips on daily dental care. Or for a restaurant, maybe behind-the-scenes food prep or local community stories. What always seems to be the biggest struggle is knowing how much promotional content people will actually tolerate before tuning out. Do you tie promotions into the educational stuff (like case studies that double as success stories)? Or keep them separate? What’s been your best-performing mix, and how do you keep it from feeling like an ad feed? Read more Share",

However, I’m trying to prevent from switching majors because I don’t want to have to spend more money for summer classes and render the classes I’m taking useless. In that case, I’m thinking of minoring in something else that can hopefully benefit me within advertising. I don’t really care for math, but I can manage as long as it isn’t calculus and preferably not economics. My minor currently is Chinese but I haven’t taken any classes(which is why im not worried about changing my minor) and I’m thinking geography with a focus in urban planning but i’m not sure.

Amazon restarted spending on Google Shopping ads across its international domains, exactly one month after abruptly pausing them – a move that now looks like a deliberate marketing test. The details: All international domains are once again running Shopping ads. The U.S. market remains excluded, raising questions about competitive strategy and channel mix. The month-long pause lines up with theories that Amazon was stress-testing reliance on Google traffic. Why we care. Amazon is one of Google&rsquo;s largest retail advertisers, and its absence reshaped the auction. When Amazon went dark, clicks rose for other retailers , but ROAS dropped , a study from Optmyzr found. This suggests that Amazon&rsquo;s presence helps keep traffic more efficient, even for competitors. The big picture . Amazon&rsquo;s selective return highlights its ability to flex advertising muscle while experimenting with acquisition costs. For rivals, the U.S. gap could be a rare window to grab market share before Amazon inevitably flips the switch back on. First seen.

Google is rolling out new loyalty integrations across Google Ads and Merchant Center, giving retailers tools to highlight member-only pricing and shipping benefits to their most valuable customers. How it works: Personalized annotations display member-only discounts or shipping benefits in both free and paid listings. A new loyalty goal in Google Ads helps retailers optimize budgets toward high-value shoppers, adjusting bids to prioritize lifetime value. Sephora US saw a 20% lift in CTR by surfacing loyalty-tier discounts in personalized ads. Why we care. With 61% of U.S. adults saying tailored loyalty programs are the most compelling part of a personalized shopping experience (according to Google), retailers face pressure to prove value beyond discounts. By surfacing member-only perks directly in search and shopping results, retailers can boost engagement from their most valuable customers and optimize spend toward higher lifetime value, not just single conversions. It&rsquo;s a way to tie loyalty programs directly to ad performance — and win more share of wallet from existing shoppers. The big picture . Loyalty features are Google&rsquo;s latest move to keep retail advertisers invested in its ecosystem — positioning search and shopping as not just discovery channels, but retention engines.

More than 1 in 5 Americans now use AI tools heavily – but traditional search engines remain dominant, with usage holding steady at 95%, according to new clickstream data from Datos and SparkToro. By the numbers: AI tools: 21% of U.S. users access AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Perplexity, and Deepseek 10+ times per month. Overall adoption has jumped from 8% in 2023 to 38% in 2025. Search engines: 95% of Americans still use Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo monthly, with 87% considered heavy Google users – up from 84% in 2023. Growth trends: AI adoption is slowing. Since September 2024, no month has shown more than 1.1x growth. By contrast, search volume per user has slightly increased year-over-year. The big picture: Despite the hype around AI replacing Google, the data seems to show the opposite. When people adopt AI tools, their Google searches also rise, SparkToro found. This echoes a Semrush study that found ChatGPT users search more , not less. Yes, but. Are there any truly &ldquo;traditional search engines&rdquo; left? Things get a bit messy when talking about &ldquo;traditional search engines&rdquo; versus the &ldquo;AI tools&rdquo; examined here, because all search engines now have AI baked in: Google is a traditional search engine (or, perhaps more accurately, an AI search engine with a legacy search experience that&rsquo;s clearly moving in the direction of AI Overviews and AI Mode), and Gemini is Google&rsquo;s AI tool. Plus, Google&rsquo;s traditional search data is being used by ChatGPT . Traditional search engine Bing has its own AI tool, Copilot, and is OpenAI&rsquo;s partner for ChatGPT Search, and feeds DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s results. Why we care . This data once again indicates that it isn&rsquo;t AI vs. search; it&rsquo;s AI plus search. Heavy AI users are also heavy searchers, meaning Google traffic declines are more about zero-click answers than AI cannibalization. The report.

Members Online • Material-Swing-4019 Sorry, Another Backlink Question Post: How to Audit/Disavow Backlinks and Gather New Ones? I'm using SEMRush, at least the free trial to see if it's worth it. It says I have 727 referring domains, 2.8K backlinks and 7 outbound domains. I have a HIGH overall toxicity score. SEMRush ranks toxicity from 0 to 100, with 100 being the worst. I'm assuming I should ask google to disavow toxic referring sites, but what number should I target as being toxic? 65 and above? Even a lot of the technically not toxic referring sites seem kinda spammy to me, like \"yktsk.top\", which has a very low toxicity score. What should I be looking at when I disavow a backlink? When it comes to gathering new links, I could really use some help here. Is the idea to publish a how-to or blog post and publish it to these blog sites that allow guest entries? I feel like Google is smart enough to know these sites are basically worthless, even if they have a high domain rank. I know enough not to go after the cheap services that offer lots of links for $25, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to get quality backlinks. I guess another good question is how much is a quality backlink worth? My local chamber of commerce charges I think $150/year to have your site listed on their site. Read more Share",

    "essence": "TV Upfronts Amazon Says It Exceeded Expectations With 'Significant Growth' in Upfront According to an Amazon spokesperson, the company's live sports and entertainment offering provided incremental volume growth Amazon held its 2025 upfront week presentation on May 12. Courtesy of Amazon By Saleah Blancaflor --> Amazon has wrapped up its second-ever upfront talks. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the news to ADWEEK today, sharing that the company finalized agreements with “significant growth” across all major holding companies and had strong commitments from independent agencies. The company said it “exceeded” its expectations in upfront commitments year over year with new and existing advertisers. According to the spokesperson, brands were “excited” by the company’s live sports offering, including the NBA, which provided incremental volume growth. Sports have been a driving force during this upfront season, several media buyers recently told ADWEEK. Prime Video’s expanded live sports portfolio includes programming across Thursday Night Football, NBA on Prime, NASCAR Cup Series, WNBA, and NWSL. Amazon is also seeing increased demand for brand partnerships across its entertainment offerings, connecting brands to Prime Video’s popular films and series, including Fallout, Oh. What. Fun, Beast Games, Merv, and Elle. It will also continue to push for innovative adtech capabilities, with a focus on making it easier for advertisers to plan, measure, and optimize their campaigns. “Amazon DSP offers customers a seamless single point of access to the best inventory, providing a holistic programmatic buying and measurement solution across both Amazon-owned properties and premium publishers,” the Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. “We will continue to serve as strategic partners to brands, working hard every day to innovate and invent on behalf of our advertising customers.” Amazon is one of the last major publishers to announce its upfront closing, following NBCUniversal , Fox , Disney , TelevisaUnivision , and Netflix . Like the others, the company did not disclose total volume or CPMs (cost per thousand viewers reached). In its first upfront close last year, Amazon shook up the upfront with an influx of inventory, leading to lower prices across the board, multiple buyers previously told ADWEEK. Amazon’s Star-Studded 2025 Upfront Charts Its Adland Takeover Strategy A star-studded event full of talent, franchises, and sports During Amazon’s upfront presentation at The Beacon Theatre in May, actors and celebs such as Arnold Schwarzenegger , Jason Momoa, Travis Kelce, Candace Parker, Jamie Lee Curtis, Elizabeth Banks, Octavia Spencer, Michael B. Jordan, John Cena, and Walton Goggins took to the stage. During the event, the company announced the renewal of the third season of Fallout, additional investments in franchises and sports, and AI-enhanced adtech. The company also shared that Amazon Ads helped advertisers reach an average monthly ad-supported audience of more than 300 million in the United States. According to the company, that reach goes across Amazon’s owned and operated properties and services like Twitch, Fire TV, Whole Foods, Amazon Music, Prime Video, and more, in addition to a diverse offering of premium publishers. According to Amazon, Prime Video has an average monthly ad-supported reach of more than 200 million global consumers, with more than 130 million in the U.S. Saleah Blancaflor Saleah Blancaflor is a TV reporter at ADWEEK. @saleyley | saleah.blancaflor@adweek.com Recommended videos The Latest Newsletters ADWEEK Daily Start your morning right with a round-up of first-look news and sharp analysis you won't find elsewhere.

So that's already a lot to rank. However, they have expanded to the Houston market, and I am only explicitly tasked with the Houston side of the site. My initial consultative advice was to build a Houston website to target the market as it would almost be impossible to rank for another market. But that's outside of my control. The service pages are not ranking (expectedly) and are all in the 90-70 range. Does anyone have any advice on ranking such a wide-spanning site, or how to handle conversations with higher-ups? Even though I'm the SEO manager, I don't have the power to get these pages to rank with the current Google search landscape. Read more Share",

Picture this (since I can't post images on here): I, a media reviewer running the website ScrollCentral, work hard to create quality content and attract viewers on social media. If my work does well, it might show up on the front page of Google for a day or two for a specific keyword. Then, while doing some reading of reviews on an old favorite game, I search \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate review.\" The first and third results are from IGN and Metacritic, two of the largest review-related sites on the web. The second is from \"Reviews by supersven,\" a site I've never heard of with a review that comes off amateurish at best that came out six months ago (the game is over 6 years old). As someone who'd kill to maintain a top SEO spot on a popular game and common keyword like that, I simply don't understand it. How on earth does content like this succeed? Is it luck? Is there some secret I don't know about? I posted a review for this same game a year or two ago and it didn't last a second. My site has been around and posting consistently for years with very little retained audience. I use RankMath SEO as best I can. What's the answer here? Read more Share",

Help I am a web developer who's been building websites for a few years, now that I'm confident in my development skills I am trying to learn more about SEO so my builds rank better. I know the very basics (keywords, page speed, accessibility, page title/meta description...) For a first project, I am working on my partner's website that I built a few years ago. She's an elopement photographer in the Banff and Lake Louise area which is an extremely saturated market with a lot of competition. However I see an opportunity since most of the competition are photographers who built their own website with limited knowledge and poor development practices. Can someone share some insights on how to help the website rank much better? For now my plan is: a LOT of blog posts and freebies (mostly guides) a strong Pinterest presence (good in this field) optimizing the Google Business Page a lot of testimonials and a dedicated page a lot of FAQs and a dedicated page I understand the concept of backlinks but hahe no idea where to start looking for them as most medias in this field won't accept simply giving her visibility cause she asked nicely.

Members Online • chriswright1666 I am worried about AI. Very worried. Discussion A lot of people don’t really understand the tools they now wield on a daily basis. Just look at the tiny % (but millions) who lost the plot when ChatGPT5 replaced 4o. I’ve been experimenting with vibe‑coding—building apps simply by telling AI what you want - for two years now. The last six months I’ve been deep in Claude Code. It’s so good… and so bad. Here’s why - and why this applies to every AI tool out there. These tools open new worlds for marketing and sales teams. They can write for you, create audio or video, even build apps. They can control your machine, automate admin, make you feel unstoppable. On the surface, it all looks slick, fast, seductive. And sometimes, surface‐level is all you need—a quick image, a five‑second clip, a few ideas, or a whitepaper conclusion. But surface‐level only takes you so far. Take vibe‑coding. Describe your dream app, and the AI will “build” it. It looks polished - until you realise it’s a house of cards: broken code, missing functions, outright fabrications. Building apps is hard. Same with content or video. No tool can yet write a 3,000‑word whitepaper end‑to‑end or produce a five‑minute promo video that’s truly ready to use. The danger? These tools, and the hype, convince people otherwise. The apps look good; the content seems right; the images look fine until you squint. The confident “Yes, that’s brilliant” AI chatbot is seductive. Don’t get me wrong, these tools are the future of work. But we’re in the early days, a powerful, confident tech most don’t fully understand. Never before have people had tools that can do so much, yet are so misunderstood. The answer? Hard work. I think it is simple as that, which no one wants to hear in an \"AI can do you work\" world. Right now AI can't do your work. But you are AI can do way better work. Learning how to use these tools is key. Understanding context windows, memory, model strengths. Getting good at guiding them, checking outputs, and knowing when not to use them. In short, rethink how you approach work—in tandem with AI, but in control of it. Here are 4 key tips for how to approach this new world of work: Prioritise AI literacy over shortcuts - Learn the fundamentals - how context limits, memory and hallucinations work. Use AI as a co‑pilot, not an autopilot. This prevents complacency and keeps you sharp. Think human first - tech second - Align AI tools with real business needs and culture. Set clear goals, assess risks, provide training. Human‑machine collaboration must be strategic, not reactive. Master the art of prompting and iteration Experiment with prompts, refine, validate, repeat. The value lies in iterative refinement—not handing off tasks wholesale to AI. Agents work but you got to baby sit them Often I can have 5 or 6 agents doing different 30 min tasks. Think about that, in 30 mins I can get 3.5hrs work done (3 by agents, 30 by me). But a lot of my 30mins is working with the agents to keep them on track. But its worth it for 3hrs free work! Read more Share",

Help I’ve noticed that some of our key branded pages have declined in both clicks and unique visits after the recent Google core update. These are high-intent pages like: - Brand + download - Brand + pricing/plans Usually, we rank #1 for these, unless a paid ad, AI overview, or SERP feature appears. But now, even without those consistently showing, and we are brand pages on top, traffic was noticeably down. Also, I don’t think sitelinks are affecting this. These pages aren’t appearing under other URLs, they’re main pages and mostly rank as primary results. Anyone else experiencing similar branded drops post-update? Open to any theories.

The August spam update started August 26 and applies worldwide. Expect possible ranking and traffic swings during the multi-week rollout.

Southern Senior News Writer at Search Engine Journal Bio Follow 2.2K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Google launched a new spam update that will affect search results worldwide. According to the Search Status Dashboard , the August spam update began today at 9:00 AM Pacific Time. It applies globally to all languages and may take a few weeks to complete. Today we released the August 2025 spam update. It may take a few weeks to complete, and we'll post on the Google Search Status Dashboard when the rollout is done: https://t.co/VyY24LVujq — Google Search Central (@googlesearchc) August 26, 2025 What Google Confirmed Google&rsquo;s incident note reads: &ldquo;Released the August 2025 spam update, which applies globally and to all languages. The rollout may take a few weeks to complete.&rdquo; No additional details were provided about specific tactics targeted. Multi-week rollouts are typical for major search updates and allow Google to monitor impact and adjust as needed. How to Respond Google hasn&rsquo;t specified targeted behaviors for this update, so the safest course is to stay aligned with established quality and spam policies. Expect some ranking and traffic volatility while the update rolls out. Avoid reactive changes during the rollout window. What to watch: Search Console trends : Impressions, clicks, average position—annotate dashboards with the official start time. Query and page-type patterns : Look for consistent movement across groups, not just single URLs. Peer movement : Compare shifts against close competitors to separate site issues from ecosystem changes. Looking Ahead Spam updates are one part of Google&rsquo;s broader ranking systems and typically ship multiple times per year alongside core updates. Sites that stay within policy guidelines should be well-positioned once rankings stabilize. Search Engine Journal will continue to monitor the update as it rolls out and provide updates when available. Featured Image: PJ McDonnell /Shutterstock Category News SEO",

ABC World News Tonight, which saw David Muir absent for the week, was helmed by Mary Bruce and Rachel Scott . The broadcast was the only one to see week-to-week declines across the board. Despite the losses, WNT remained the leader in total viewers and the demo. Note: The weekly averages of CBS News and NBC News’ newscasts are based on four days (Monday to Thursday). Friday’s (08/22/25) CBS broadcast was retitled to CBS Evening Nws and NBC’s broadcast was retitled to NBC Nitely News due to NFL preseason games. These broadcasts were excluded from the weekly and season averages. According to live-plus-same-day data from Nielsen, ABC World News Tonight with David Muir averaged 6.916 million total viewers and 838,000 Adults 25-54 demo viewers for the week of August 18. It saw losses of -1% in total viewers and -10% in the demo compared to the previous week —the only newscast with week-to-week declines in both categories. Looking at its performance to the same week in 2024 ( the week beginning August 19 ), WNT was down by -2% in total viewers and -12% in the demo. In second place in total viewers and the demo was NBC Nightly News, averaging 5.665 million and 792,000 viewers, respectively. The broadcast was down by -1% in total viewers but grew by +2% in the A25-54 demo. Of note: The Wednesday broadcast finished ahead of WNT in the demo, the third time this happened during Llamas’ tenure . When comparing its performance to the same week a year ago, Nightly News saw gains of +8% in total viewers and +1% in the demo—the only newscast with year-over-year growth. CBS Evening News had 3.775 million total viewers and 478,000 viewers in the demo for the week of August 18. The broadcast was the only one to show gains in the total viewers category, as it rose by +1%, but it dropped by -8% in the demo compared to the previous week.

    "essence": "Search Engine Land » SEO » Article ChatGPT’s answers came from Google Search after all: Report Published: August 26, 2025 at 11:33 am Read Time: 2 minutes Share Written by Danny Goodwin Table of Contents Table of Contents Even ChatGPT leaned on Google’s search results via a scraping service – underscoring how crucial Google’s index remains in the AI search era. Multiple tests have suggested ChatGPT is using Google Search . Well, a new report seems to confirm ChatGPT is indeed using Google Search data. OpenAI quietly used (and may still be using) a Google Search scraping service to power ChatGPT&rsquo;s answers on real-time topics like news, sports, and finance, according to The Information. The details. OpenAI used SerpApi, an 8-year-old scraping firm, to extract Google results. SerpApi reportedly listed OpenAI as a customer on its site as recently as May 2024. That listing was later removed for unknown reasons. ( Here&rsquo;s evidence via the Wayback Machine .) Google has reportedly long tried to block SerpApi&rsquo;s crawler, though it&rsquo;s unclear how effective those efforts have been. Other SerpApi customers reportedly include Meta, Apple, and Perplexity. Zoom out. This revelation contrasts with OpenAI&rsquo;s public stance that ChatGPT search relies on its own crawler, Microsoft Bing, and licensed publisher data. During Google&rsquo;s antitrust trial, ChatGPT exec Nick Turley indicated Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing had &ldquo;significant quality issues&rdquo; and indicated that Google&rsquo;s index would accelerate OpenAI&rsquo;s search ambitions. Meanwhile. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently dismissed Google Search , saying: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use Google anymore. I legitimately cannot tell you the last time I did a Google search.&rdquo; Well, based on this news, it seems like he probably is using Google Search all the time within his own product. Why we care . Google&rsquo;s search index remains the foundation of online discovery – so much so that even its biggest AI search rival appears to be using it to partially power ChatGPT. This is yet another reminder that SEO isn&rsquo;t going anywhere just yet. If Google&rsquo;s results are valuable to OpenAI, they remain essential for driving visibility, traffic, and business outcomes. The report.

YOU WILL BE BANNED. r/Advertising: Is for ad creators, students, copywriters, and anyone else who is finely honing their reverse banner blindness for professional reasons. Members Online • Appropriate_East_665 Is FBA still reliable with Random Tariffs? r/Sacrumgroup • Is FBA still reliable with Random Tariffs? The Answer is Yes and No both. Even after tariffs Amazon is just like starting any business some sellers will make a killing, others will lose money and move on. With FBA + sourcing from China, tariffs are affecting profitability, but honestly it all comes down to managing 5 key things. : 1️. The Right Product Tariffs affect the most when you’re selling in highly competitive, low-margin categories. In other words the \"Uncertain/ Low Potential Products\" ( I had an entire meeting with an expert on this category alone and there are ways out for such products as well, difficult but not impossible) A simple way to check if a product has potential: Opportunity Score = Search Volume Average ÷ Competitor Ratings If a keyword has 12,000 searches/month and top competitors average 3.7 stars: 12,000 ÷ 3.7 = 3,243 → That’s promising: Demand is there, and competitors are weak. Prefer niches where you can either: -Bear margins without cutting margins -Change Price based on premium positioning 2️. Knowing Your Profit Margins (with Tariffs) When importing from China, tariffs do affect COGS, which impacts net profit. Net Profit = (Selling Price − Amazon Fees − COGS − Shipping − Tariffs) × Units Sold Say you sell a product for $30, Amazon Fees = $8, COGS (China) = $10, Shipping = $4, Tariff = 10% of COGS = $1 Net Profit per Unit = $40 − $8 − $10 − $4 − $1 = $17 If you sell 300 units/month: $17 × 300 = $5,100/month in net profit even with tariffs applied. But if you’re working on very thin margins (<25%), tariffs will make it hard for you, so factor them in before even talking to a supplier. 3️. Budgeting for Ads (Because FBA Is Pay-to-Play Now) Even if tariffs minimize your landed cost, you can still go for it only if you keep the ad cost within your margin range. ACoS = (Ad Spend ÷ Sales Revenue) × 100 15–20% ACoS → Profitable in most categories 30%+ ACoS → Not going to be profitable. Either pricing is off or ad targeting needs fixing Test before scaling. So, start small with segmented campaigns → monitor CTR, CPC, and conversion rates before going all in with ehavy budgets. 4️. Managing Inventory Efficiently Tariffs will definitely make you rethink your order sized. If you order more stock you will incur more costs. If you understock, you lose rank and momentum.

Bluepear 18 hours ago ⋅ 8 min read Bluepear Bluepear Bio Follow 116 READS This post was sponsored by Bluepear . The opinions expressed in this article are the sponsor&rsquo;s own. Have you ever seen an ad that looks just like your favorite brand&rsquo;s ad, but isn&rsquo;t? Ad hijacking . Ever clicked an ad expecting to reach Nike&rsquo;s website but ended up on some random store you&rsquo;d never heard of? Ad hijacking. It happens to thousands of companies that run paid ads, and you&rsquo;re not immune. More people are buying products and services online. With $6 trillion being spent by online shoppers in 2024 (CapitalOneShopping Research), the competition for ad placement is fierce. If someone hijacks your ads, you: lose traffic. lose money. lose trust. Ad hijacking harms your brand and ad performance. In This Guide: 1. What Is Ad Hijacking? 2. Secret Tactics That Are Used To Hide Ad Hijacking 3. Direct Impact Of Ad Hijacking On Your Company 4. How To Spot And Prevent Ad Hijacking 5. Modern Tools To Catch What Manual Audits Miss 6. Protect Your Brand From Ad Hijacking Learn how to detect ad hijacking , stop affiliate abuse, and protect your traffic in 2025. What Is Ad Hijacking ? Ad hijacking , by definition, is a form of advertising fraud where someone pretends to be your brand in paid search ads (like Google or other platforms). The fraudsters copy your brand name, your ad style, even your messaging, so the ad looks real. But when a customer clicks, they&rsquo;re sent somewhere else. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 There are two common types: Affiliate ad hijacking. Competitor ad hijacking. What Is Affiliate Ad Hijacking? Affiliate ad hijacking happens when partners in your affiliate program bid on your brand name. They: copy your ad (same headline, same style) so it looks like the real thing. The Result: The customer thinks they&rsquo;re clicking on your official site because the ad looks the same. But behind the scenes, the affiliate redirects the traffic through their own tracking link. You end up paying them a commission for a customer who was already looking for you. This inflates your costs, pollutes your data, and makes it harder to measure real performance. Example: A user searches for [Super Tools]. An affiliate runs an ad with the headline &ldquo;Super Tools Official Site,&rdquo; but the link is an affiliate redirect. You pay them a cut, even though they didn&rsquo;t bring in new traffic. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 What Is Competitor Ad Hijacking? Competitor ad hijacking is when a rival company copies your brand in search ads to steal your traffic. They: bid on your brand name, use ad text that looks like yours, sometimes even mimic your domain. The Result : Customers click, thinking they&rsquo;re going to your site. But instead, they land on the competitor&rsquo;s website. This tactic lets competitors capture high-intent traffic. As a result, you lose potential sales, while they gain market share. Without PPC brand protection, your brand presence can be weakened, allowing competitors to grow faster at your expense. Example: A competitor bids on &ldquo;Super Tools&rdquo; and runs a lookalike ad. The user clicks, expecting your site, but lands on the competitor&rsquo;s product page instead. You lose a sale and possibly the customer&rsquo;s trust. As you see, search hijacking is already a serious threat to your brand and budget. It&rsquo;s made even worse by how well the violators hide their tracks. Secret Tactics That Are Used To Hide Ad Hijacking Non-compliant partners use smart tactics to avoid being seen by brand owners or their teams. Here&rsquo;s how they do it: GEO targeting. Ads are shown only in specific countries, cities, or regions. If you&rsquo;re not in that area, you&rsquo;ll never see them – but your local customers will. Dayparting. Hijackers run ads at night, on weekends, or during holidays when your team is less likely to notice them. Cloaking and dynamic redirects. They use scripts to show one version of the ad or landing page to Google (to pass review) and a different one to users – usually a fake or affiliate redirect. Smaller search engines. Many hijackers avoid Google and run campaigns on Bing or other second-tier platforms, where rules are looser and tracking is weaker. Without proper hijacking prevention , these tactics make it easy for hijackers to hide and hard for your team to catch them in time. Direct Impact Of Ad Hijacking On Your Company The impact of affiliate ad hijacking goes far beyond a few stolen clicks. It damages performance, costs money, and creates serious risks for your business: Lost ad budget. You pay commissions to affiliates who didn&rsquo;t bring you new traffic; they just hijacked what was already yours. Higher CPC and more competition. Hijackers bid on your brand keywords, driving up your costs and competing against your own campaigns. Broken attribution. Without hijacking prevention, your analytics get messy. It becomes harder to measure what&rsquo;s really working because affiliate hijacking inflates performance data. Reputation damage. Users may land on shady or misleading pages. They won&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s not your site – they&rsquo;ll just stop trusting your brand. Compliance risks. If you&rsquo;re in a regulated industry (finance, health, etc.), fake ads and unapproved messaging can create legal trouble or policy violations. Search hijacking doesn&rsquo;t just hurt your numbers. It makes you question the data you rely on, wastes hours chasing false leads, and forces you to fight for traffic that was already yours. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 85% of consumers avoid buying from brands that generate unsafe experiences, and ad hijacking falls into that bucket (PwC Report). 75% of ad hijacking comes from affiliate partners exploiting tracking gaps to earn unearned commissions (Neilpatel). Up to 30% of affiliate commissions come from hijacking and similar deceptive tactics (AffiliateWP). Ad hijacking caused an estimated $12.6 billion in losses in 2023, based on 15% of the $84 billion lost to ad fraud globally (Juniper Research). How To Spot And Prevent Ad Hijacking What actually works on PPC brand protection? To uncover real issues, you need tools and methods that go beyond surface metrics: Step 1: Quick Manual Checks Run branded keyword searches and audit SERPs – look for near-identical copy linking to another domain. Watch for anomalies in performance (CPC spikes, conversion drops, affiliate surges). Review affiliate conversion patterns – unusual regional spikes may signal fraud. Geo-test with VPNs or third-party tools to uncover geo-targeted hijacks. Track impression share – sudden drops without budget changes mean new competition. Step 2: Scalable Prevention Tactics Behavioral simulation : Mimic real user searches across devices and browsers to reveal hidden hijacks. Geo-rotation & proxy use : Detect localized hijacking attempts. Proof collection : Document ads, redirects, affiliate IDs, and keywords for enforcement. Real-time alerts & auto takedown : Get notified instantly and stop fraudulent ads before they drain your budget. By combining manual checks and scalable tools, you can take control before search hijacking quietly eats into your ad spend. Modern Tools To Catch What Manual Audits Miss Manual checks can&rsquo;t keep up with how ad hijacking works today. Hijackers often run ads only in certain regions, at non-working hours, or under specific conditions. They use cloaking and redirects that can&rsquo;t be detected with regular checks. Most teams lack the time and capability to ensure hijacking prevention through manual monitoring alone. That&rsquo;s why ad hijacking tools like Bluepear are essential – as PPC brand protection software, they automate continuous scanning of search results to catch every sneaky ad trying to hijack your traffic and budget. Here&rsquo;s how Bluepear helps to fight against ad hijacking: Simulates real user behavior.

If you want to survive in a world of smart fraud, automated PPC brand protection is a must. Image created by Bluepear, August 2025 Protect Your Brand From Ad Hijacking Ad hijacking quietly eats into your ad budget, distorts your performance data, and damages user trust. Manual audits rarely catch it. Hijackers use GEO targeting, dayparting, and cloaking to stay hidden while stealing high-intent traffic and commissions.

The ad hijacking tool automatically checks SERPs from different GEOs, devices, and browsers to keep your brand protected from fraud.

I’m the sole marketing person at a financial institution of about 120. 3x per month, I’m responsible for sending out our “loan bonus” email to our loan broker network. These are not small bonuses, some loan broker shops can earn over $300k a month just in bonuses. Many of these loan brokers don’t share the bonus program with their employees , and want us to only email specific people about it (they keep the $ for their leadership team). Every time before I send a bonus email, I get MAJOR anxiety about accidentally emailing the bonus to a loan broker shop employee that shouldn’t know about it (their employees are sales people selling our product). We have list filtering but I’m always worried one person slipped through (our sales team checks off who can get it in Salesforce, but they’ve made mistakes before). If the wrong person gets it, it could ruin a multi-million dollar relationship with a broker that does business with us. I always spot check but there are over 500 recipients. How can I manage my anxiety about this? Read more Share",

Perplexity 'Comet Plus' pays publishers for visits, citations, and agent actions. Available on its own, or included with Pro and Max subscriptions. Revenue is shared with websites, minus a small compute fee. SEJ STAFF Matt G. Southern 18 hours ago ⋅ 2 min read SEJ STAFF Matt G. Southern Senior News Writer at Search Engine Journal Bio Follow 506 READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Perplexity announced Comet Plus, a monthly subscription that pays participating publishers when people read their work and when AI systems use it to answer questions. The company says subscriber payments go to partners, with a small portion retained to cover compute costs. How Comet Plus Works Comet Plus will be available for $5 per month. Existing Perplexity Pro and Max subscribers will have Comet Plus included. Subscribers get direct access to participating publisher sites, answers informed by those sources, and agent workflows that can complete tasks on those sites. The offering is tied to the Comet browser and assistant. About Revenue Sharing Perplexity positions Comet Plus as a compensation model for an AI-centric web. Publishers are paid for three interaction types: Human visits Search citations Agent actions. Perplexity&rsquo;s example of &ldquo;agent traffic&rdquo; is Comet Assistant scanning a calendar and suggesting relevant reading from publisher sites. The idea is to reflect how people now consume information across browsing, AI answers, and agent workflows. Perplexity wrote: &ldquo;Comet Plus is the first compensation model... based on three types of internet traffic: human visits, search citations, and agent actions.&rdquo; Availability Interested publishers can email publishers@perplexity.ai to request to join the program. Why It Matters For publishers and marketers, the model expands monetization and measurement beyond traditional clicks. Websites are testing a range of responses to AI usage of their content, from blocking crawlers to signing licenses. Comet Plus differs from flat-fee deals by tying payouts to actual user and assistant activity, which could align compensation more closely with real demand. Looking Ahead Perplexity says it will announce an initial roster of publishing partners when the Comet browser becomes available to all users for free. Early adoption, reporting transparency, and real revenue for partners will determine whether this model becomes a viable framework or stays a niche experiment. Category News Generative AI",

VIP CONTRIBUTOR Kevin Indig 18 hours ago ⋅ 8 min read VIP CONTRIBUTOR Kevin Indig Growth Advisor Bio Follow 1.5K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Boost your skills with Growth Memo&rsquo;s weekly expert insights. Subscribe for free ! More data shows ChatGPT isn&rsquo;t taking market share away from Google. Instead, it&rsquo;s expanding the range of use cases and blurring the line between searching for information and performing tasks. I looked at Similarweb data to understand how this affects four different stages of the user journey across Google and ChatGPT: Usage. Behavior. Outbound clicks. Converting. What I found is that ChatGPT adoption is, essentially, a 400,000-pound locomotive barreling down the tracks with no intention of stopping anytime soon. User conversations within ChatGPT are rich in context, which leads to higher conversion rates when intent shifts from information seeking or generating to buying. Lastly, and also most notably for SEOs and growth marketers, ChatGPT is sending a lot more users out to the web. Of course, all of these stats are still small in comparison to Google. However, no effort from Google has been able to slow the momentum of ChatGPT&rsquo;s runaway train. About the data I used in this analysis: Data source: Similarweb (shoutout to Sam Sheridan). Time period examined: July 2024 – June 2025 (last 12 months) vs. July 2023 – June 2024 (previous 12 months). I also examined U.S. vs. UK user behavior. Image Credit Kevin Indig Visits: ChatGPT Is Growing At Rapid Pace People are rushing to ChatGPT. Over the last 12 months in the U.S., ChatGPT visits grew from 3.5 to 6.8 billion visits (+94%). In the UK, it was even faster: 131% YoY, from 868 million to 2 billion. Over the same time span, Google growth stagnated. Here&rsquo;s what the data showed: U.S. stagnation: -0.85% (196 vs. 194 billion). UK stagnation: -0.22% (35.56 vs. 35.49 billion). Image Credit: Kevin Indig To put it into perspective: Google had almost 200 billion visits in the U.S. over the last 12 months, compared to ChatGPT&rsquo;s 6.8 billion. So, ChatGPT has a mere 3.4% of Google&rsquo;s total visits. However, if growth rates hold steady, in theory, ChatGPT could hit Google&rsquo;s volume in the next five years. My hypothesis: It&rsquo;s almost guaranteed that ChatGPT won&rsquo;t hit Google&rsquo;s visit volume because there are too many moving parts (energy/chip limitations, training data, quality improvements, regulation, etc.). But consider that Google has declined by -0.85% (~2 billion visits) year-over-year, and you can see where this is going. Visits can only tell you so much. Recent data from Semrush and Profound suggests that one-third to two-thirds of user intent when interacting with AI chatbots is generative, meaning users use ChatGPT to do and less to search [ 1 , 2 ] . Leaked chats from ChatGPT and other AI chatbots confirm the aggregate data. So, even when we compare visits to ChatGPT vs. Google, they&rsquo;re not leading to the same outcome. But, against that argument, I will say that Google morphs more into a mirror of ChatGPT with AI Mode – and every generative intent has a high chance of including information along the conversation journey that is sourced to other sites or creators. The conversational nature of AI chatbots means intent is fluid and can change from one prompt to the next. Along the way, it&rsquo;s likely users come across information in their conversations that would&rsquo;ve been a classic Google Search for products or solutions. At the end of the day, ChatGPT is continuing its adoption as the fastest-growing product on earth to date. What does that mean for you? Stay the course. Keep tracking referral traffic, conversions, and topic visibility on Google + ChatGPT. Optimize for visibility with a strong focus on classic SEO. Keep an ear to the ground and learn as much as you can. Things are evolving fast, and clarity will come with time. Quick reminder here: I recently transitioned my WhatsApp group over to Slack. I share ongoing news and learnings throughout the week openly and freely, so it&rsquo;s a great place to stay updated without all the extra (and sometimes overwhelming) noise. No need to be a premium subscriber to get access to the main discussion channel. Join here ! On The Platform: User Behavior Context Is Rich Old habits are hard to break. People are used to searching on Google a certain way, while ChatGPT is a green field. For the overwhelming majority of us, our first experience with ChatGPT was a conversation, so we all adopted it as the default way to engage. Image Credit: Kevin Indig As a result, the average query prompt length on ChatGPT vs. Google is: 80 words vs 3.4 in the U.S. 91 words vs. 3.2 in the UK. Even informational prompts are 10 times longer (~38 words) on ChatGPT than on Google. People ask more detailed questions, which reveal much more about themselves and their intent. Together with a growing context window, ChatGPT returns much more personalized and (usually) better informational answers – I&rsquo;m still waiting on consistently better commercial/purchase intent outcomes. [ 3 ] AI chatbots compress the user journey from many queries over several days to one conversation with lengthy prompts. For you, this means it&rsquo;s even more critical to monitor the right prompts. (I shared a trick with premium subscribers for finding prompts in Google Search Console from AI Mode in Is AI cutting into your SEO conversions? ) Referral Traffic: Outgoing ChatGPT Traffic Grew By 723% In The US As referral traffic from Google reached historic lows, ChatGPT&rsquo;s referral traffic reached new highs. Image Credit: Kevin Indig Over the last 12 months, ChatGPT&rsquo;s U.S. referral traffic to websites jumped by +3,496% (UK: +5,950%), from 14 to 516 million (after cleaning up referrals to Openai.com, which are mostly authentications). In comparison, Google&rsquo;s outgoing referral visits grew only +23% in the U.S. and 19% in the UK. When you consider Google referrals include navigational searches (people navigating to the homepage of a brand) and ad clicks (ChatGPT doesn&rsquo;t yet have ads), 23% is not much at all. ChatGPT&rsquo;s referral traffic to external websites makes up ~27% of Google&rsquo;s (1.9 billion, in the last 12 months), based on the data. That feels high, in my field observation. Also consider that ChatGPT&rsquo;s goal is not necessarily to send out traffic but to keep the conversation going until users have the optimal response. That being said, referral traffic has grown and continues to do so. Until recently. According to Profound, ChatGPT&rsquo;s referral traffic was down -52% between July 21 and August 20. [ 4 ] And that&rsquo;s significant. Time will tell whether this is just an experiment or a final decision. For you, this means you should see more ChatGPT referral traffic over the last 12 months if you optimize well. You might not see an increase of +3,500%, but if you&rsquo;re not seeing at least some growth, it&rsquo;s likely your competitors are. Conversions: ChatGPT > Google Conversions from ChatGPT are small in comparison with Google (in volume), but they&rsquo;re growing rapidly. The whole narrative of investing in AI visibility optimization (AEO/GEO/LLMO) banks on the fact that it will continue at the same pace and become meaningful. So far, it seems like that bet will work out. Image Credit: Kevin Indig When ChatGPT sends traffic to sites, the conversion rate is usually higher than Google&rsquo;s. As of June 2025: ChatGPT&rsquo;s conversion rate of transactional traffic was 6.9% in the U.S. compared to 5.4% for Google. In the UK, ChatGPT reached 5.5%, which is on par with Google. ChatGPT sends higher-quality traffic to websites, at least in the U.S. I define quality in this context as &ldquo;higher intent,&rdquo; meaning visitors are more likely to convert into customers. The reason ChatGPT traffic is of higher quality is that users get answers to their questions in one conversation. When they click out, they&rsquo;re &ldquo;primed&rdquo; to buy. To me, the bigger question is how purchase decisions are influenced before a click happens (or even when no click-out happens). For you, this means: Look at which pages get referral traffic. Take the average referral traffic and optimize pages that get some but below-average clicks. Optimizing for citations matters because citations are what get clicked. Look at the citation gap between your competitors and your site. Look for conversion optimization opportunities (in-line CTAs, lead gen assets, quizzes, etc) on pages that get ChatGPT referral traffic. Using a standard heatmap tool will point you to areas of the page that are ideal for a little CRO. Bringing It All Together ChatGPT has all the ingredients to become the next big user platform on which other companies can build – just like Google 25 years ago: Usage is growing. Behavior is rich in context. Referral traffic is shooting up. Conversions happen at a healthy rate. Now, traffic and conversations just need more volume. They&rsquo;re still tiny in comparison.

Usually, the summer season is pretty busy but since last year, it's been pretty quiet. I reached out to some of the people in the field and they confirmed that it's been really quiet. 2024 was almost dead. The production studios I talked to claimed they didn't have a shoot for like 4-5 months. I have been getting gigs but the clients are not approving of the budgets even tho they are the same as usual. I reached to one of my clients, they said that the price is reasonable but they don't have a budget so they pulled the project off of my table. Is anyone else seeing a slow season? Read more Share",

What would you do to beat the industry leader? Question I am a bit upset with this whole marketing world... Maybe I am just jealous... Case studies are often rigged - in terms of big corps have the power to \"push through\" SEO, Google Ads easily, and can test everything with their \"endless\" money. For, little brands, they have to hack everything and figure out what works on a lower scale... E.g. if you want to launch a Pmax campaign, but in a very, very niche IT security B2B enterprise market, and the competitor has 100x more resources, and they do not need leads from Google Ads they are just there to brand themselves - but because of this, the price is so high that you can not test anything… Free market my ass :D Sorry for venting this.

    "essence": "Search Engine Land » SEO » Article Historic recurrence in search: Why AI feels familiar and what’s next Published: August 26, 2025 at 9:00 am Read Time: 10 minutes Share Written by Marcus Miller Table of Contents Table of Contents AI is changing how people search – again. Learn what decades of search history can teach us about adapting to the next big shift. Historic recurrence is the idea that patterns repeat over time, even if the details differ. In digital marketing , change is the only constant. Over the last 30 years, we&rsquo;ve seen nonstop shifts and transformations in platforms and tactics. Search, social, and mobile have each gone through their own waves of evolution. But AI represents something bigger – not just another tactic, but a fundamental shift in how people research, evaluate, and buy products and services. Estimates vary, but Gartner projects that AI-driven search could account for 25% of search volume by the end of 2026. I suspect the true share will be much higher as Google weaves AI deeper into its results. For digital marketers, it can feel like we need a crystal ball to predict what&rsquo;s next. While we don&rsquo;t have magical foresight, we do have the next best thing: lessons from the past. This article looks back at the early days of search, how user behavior evolved alongside technology, and what those patterns can teach us as we navigate the AI era. The early days: Wild and wonderful queries If you remember the early web – AltaVista, Lycos, Yahoo, Hotbot – search was a free-for-all. People typed in long, rambling queries, sometimes entire sentences, other times just a few random words that &ldquo;felt&rdquo; right. There were no search suggestions, no &ldquo;people also ask,&rdquo; and no autocorrect. It was a simpler time, often summed up as &ldquo;10 blue links.&rdquo; Searchers had to experiment, refine, and iterate on their own, and the variance in query wording was huge. For marketers, that meant opportunity. You could capture traffic in all sorts of unexpected ways simply by having relevant pages indexed. Back then, SEO was, in large part, about one thing: existing in the index. Dig deeper: A guide to Google: Origins, history and key moments in search Google&rsquo;s rise: From exploration to efficiency Anyone working in digital marketing in the early 2000s will remember. From Day 1, Google felt different. The quality of its results was markedly better. Then came Google Suggest in 2008, quietly changing the game. Suddenly, you didn&rsquo;t have to finish typing your thought. Google would complete it for you, based on the most common searches. Research from Moz and others at the time showed that autocomplete reduced query length and variance. People defaulted to Google&rsquo;s suggestions because it was faster and easier. This marked a significant shift in our behavior as searchers. We moved from sprawling, exploratory queries to shorter, more standardized ones. It&rsquo;s not surprising. When something can be achieved with less effort, human nature drives us toward the path of least resistance. Once again, technology had changed how we search and find information. Mobile, voice, and the second compression The shift to mobile accelerated this compression. Tiny keyboards and on-the-go contexts meant people typed as little as possible. Autocomplete , voice input, and &ldquo;search as you type&rdquo; all encouraged brevity. At the same time, Google kept rolling out features that answered questions directly, creating a blended, multi-contextual SERP. The cumulative effect? Search behavior became more predictable and uniform. For marketers running Google Ads or tracking performance in Google Analytics and Search Console , this shift came with another challenge: less data. Long-tail keywords shrank, while most traffic and budget concentrated on a smaller set of high-volume terms. Once again, our search behavior – and the insights we could glean from it – had evolved. Zero-click search and the walled garden By the late 2010s, zero-click searches were on the rise. Google – and even social platforms – wanted to keep users inside their ecosystems. More and more questions were answered directly in the search results. Search got smarter, and shorter queries could deliver more refined results thanks to personalization and past interactions. Google started doing everything for us. Search for a flight? You&rsquo;d see Google Flights. A restaurant? Google Maps. A product? Google Shopping. Information? YouTube . You get the picture. For businesses built on organic traffic, this shift was disruptive. But for users, it felt seamless – arguably a better experience, even if it created new challenges for optimizers. Get the newsletter search marketers rely on. See terms. Quality vs. brevity This shift worked – until it didn&rsquo;t. One common complaint today is that search results feel worse . It&rsquo;s a complicated issue to unpack. Have search results actually gotten worse? Or are the results as good as ever, but the underlying sites have declined in quality? It&rsquo;s tricky to call. What is certain is that as traffic declined, many sites got more aggressive – adding more ads, more pop-ups, and sneakier lead gen CTAs to squeeze more value from fewer clicks. The search results themselves have also become a bewildering mix of ads, organic listings, and SERP features. To deliver better results from shorter queries, search engines have had to guess at intent while still sending enough clicks to advertisers and publishers to keep the ecosystem running. And as traffic-starved publishers got more desperate, user experience took a nosedive. Anyone who has had to scroll through a food blogger&rsquo;s life story – while dodging pop-ups and auto-playing ads – just to get to a recipe knows how painful this can be. It&rsquo;s this chaotic landscape that, in part, has driven the move to answer engines like ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs). People are simply tired of panning for gold in the search results. The AI era: From compression back to conversation Up to this point, the pattern has been clear: the average query length kept getting shorter. But AI is changing the game again, and the query-length pendulum is now swinging sharply in the opposite direction. Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google&rsquo;s own AI Mode are making it normal to type or speak longer, more detailed questions again. We can now: Ask questions instead of searching for keywords. Refine queries conversationally. Ask follow-ups without starting over. And as users, we can finally skip the over-optimized lead gen traps that have made the web a worse place overall. Here&rsquo;s the key point: we&rsquo;ve gone from mid-length, varied queries in the early days, to short, refined queries over the last 12 years or so, and now to full, detailed questions in the AI era. The way we seek information has changed once more. We&rsquo;re no longer just searching for sources of information. We&rsquo;re asking detailed questions to get clear, direct answers. And as AI becomes more tightly integrated into Google over the coming months and years, this shift will continue to reshape how we search – or, more accurately, how we question – Google. Dig deeper: SEO in an AI-powered world: What changed in just a year AI and search: Google playing catch-up Google was a little behind the AI curve. ChatGPT launched in late 2022 to massive buzz and unprecedented adoption. Google&rsquo;s AI Overviews – frankly underwhelming by comparison – didn&rsquo;t roll out until mid-2024. After launching in the U.S. in mid-June and the U.K. in late July 2025 , Google&rsquo;s full AI Mode is now available in 180 countries and territories around the world. Now, we can ask more detailed, multi-part questions and get thorough answers – without battling through the lead gen traps that clutter so many websites. The reality is simple: this is a better system. This is progress. Want to know the best way to boil an egg – and whether the process changes for eggs stored in the fridge versus at room temperature? Just ask. Google will often decide if an AI Overview is helpful and generate it on the fly, considering both parts of your question. What is the best way to boil an egg? Does it differ if they are from the fridge? The AI Overview answers the question directly. And if you want to keep going, you can click the bold &ldquo;Dive deeper in AI Mode&rdquo; button to continue the conversation. Inside AI Mode, you get streamlined, conversational answers to questions that traditional search could answer – just without the manual trawling or the painfully over-optimized, pop-up-heavy recipe sites. From shorter queries to shorter journeys Stepping back, we can see how behavior is shifting – and how it ties to human nature&rsquo;s tendency to seek the path of least resistance. The &ldquo;easy&rdquo; option used to be entering short queries and wading through an increasingly complex mix of results to find what you needed. Now, the path of least resistance is to put in a bit more effort upfront – asking a longer, more refined question – and let the AI do the heavy lifting. A search for the best steak restaurant nearby once meant seven separate queries and reviewing over 100 sites. That&rsquo;s a lot of donkey work you can now skip. It&rsquo;s a subtle shift: slightly more work up front, but a far smoother journey in return. This change also aligns with a classic computing principle: GIGO – garbage in, garbage out. A more refined, context-rich question gives the system better input, which produces a more useful, accurate output. Historic recurrence: The pattern revealed Looking back, it&rsquo;s clear there&rsquo;s a repeating cycle in how technology shapes search behavior. The early web (1990s) Behavior: Long, experimental, often clumsy queries. Why: No guidance, poor relevance, and lots of trial-and-error. Marketing lesson: Simply having relevant content was often enough to capture traffic. Google + Autocomplete (2000s) Behavior: Queries got shorter and more standardized. Why: Google Suggest and smarter algorithms nudged users toward the most common phrases. Marketing lesson: Keyword targeting became more focused, with heavier competition around fewer, high-volume terms. Mobile and voice era (2010s–early 2020s) Behavior: Even shorter, highly predictable queries. Why: Tiny keyboards, voice assistants, and SERP features that answered questions directly. Marketing lesson: The long tail collapsed into clusters. Zero-click searches rose. Winning visibility meant optimizing for snippets and structured data. AI conversation era (2023–present) Behavior: Longer, natural-language queries return – now in back-and-forth conversations. Why: Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity encourage refinement, context, and multi-step questions. Marketing lesson: It&rsquo;s no longer about just showing up. It&rsquo;s about being the best answer – authoritative, helpful, and easy for AI to surface. Technology drives change The key takeaway is that technology drives changes in how people ask questions. And tactically, we&rsquo;ve come full circle – closer to the early days of search than we&rsquo;ve been in years. Despite all the doom and gloom around SEO, there&rsquo;s real opportunity in the AI era for those who adapt. What this means for SEO, AEO, LLMO, GEO – and beyond The environment is changing. Technology is reshaping how we seek information – and how we expect answers to be delivered. Traditional search engine results are still important. Don&rsquo;t abandon conventional SEO. But now, we also need to optimize for answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google&rsquo;s AI Mode. That means developing deeper insight into your customer segments and fully understanding the journey from awareness to interest to conversion. Talk to your customers. Run surveys. Reach out to those who didn&rsquo;t convert and ask why. Then weave those insights into genuinely helpful content that can be found, indexed, and surfaced by the large language models powering these new platforms. It&rsquo;s a brave new world – but an incredibly exciting one to be part of.

    "essence": "Consumer Trust And Perception Of AI In Marketing How consumer trust in AI marketing is shaped by culture, transparency, and emotion, and what brands need to get right in different markets. Nicole Alexander 18 hours ago ⋅ 13 min read Nicole Alexander Bio Follow 298 READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> This edited excerpt is from Ethical AI in Marketing by Nicole Alexander &copy;2025 and is reproduced and adapted with permission from Kogan Page Ltd. Recent research highlights intriguing paradoxes in consumer attitudes toward AI-driven marketing. Consumers encounter AI-powered marketing interactions frequently, often without realizing it. According to a 2022 Pew Research Center survey, 27% of Americans reported interacting with AI at least several times a day, while another 28% said they interact with AI about once a day or several times a week (Pew Research Center, 2023). As AI adoption continues to expand across industries, marketing applications – from personalized recommendations to chatbots – are increasingly shaping consumer experiences. According to McKinsey & Company (2023), AI-powered personalization can deliver five to eight times the ROI on marketing spend and significantly boost customer engagement. In this rapidly evolving landscape, trust in AI has become a crucial factor for successful adoption and long-term engagement. The World Economic Forum under&shy;scores that &ldquo;trust is the foundation for AI&rsquo;s widespread acceptance,&rdquo; and emphasizes the necessity for companies to adopt self-governance frameworks that prioritize transparency, accountability, and fairness (World Economic Forum, 2025). The Psychology Of AI Trust Consumer trust in AI marketing systems operates fundamentally differently from traditional marketing trust mechanisms. Where traditional marketing trust builds through brand familiarity and consistent experiences, AI trust involves additional psychological dimensions related to automation, decision-making autonomy, and perceived control. Understanding these differences is crucial for organizations seek&shy;ing to build and maintain consumer trust in their AI marketing initiatives. Cognitive Dimensions Neurological studies offer intriguing insights into how our brains react to AI. Research from Stanford University reveals that we process information differently when interacting with AI-powered systems. For example, when evaluating AI-generated product recommendations, our brains activate distinct neural path&shy;ways compared to those triggered by recommendations from a human salesperson. This crucial difference highlights the need for marketers to understand how consum&shy;ers cognitively process AI-driven interactions. There are three key cognitive factors that have emerged as critical influences on AI trust, including perceived control, understanding of mechanisms, and value recognition. Emotional Dimensions Consumer trust in AI marketing is deeply influenced by emotional factors, which often override logical evaluations. These emotional responses shape trust in several key ways: Anxiety and privacy concerns : Despite AI&rsquo;s convenience, 67% of consumers express anxiety about how their data is used, reflecting persistent privacy concerns (Pew Research Center, 2023). This tension creates a paradoxical relationship where consumers benefit from AI-driven marketing while simultaneously fearing its potential misuse. Trust through repeated interactions : Emotional trust in AI systems develops iteratively through repeated, successful interactions, particularly when systems demonstrate high accuracy, consistent performance, and empathetic behavior. Experimental studies show that emotional and behavioral trust accumulate over time, with early experiences strongly shaping later perceptions. In repeated legal decision-making tasks, users exhibited growing trust toward high-performing AI, with initial interactions significantly influencing long-term reliance (Kahr et al., 2023). Emotional trust can follow nonlinear pathways – dipping after failures but recovering through empathetic interventions or improved system performance (Tsumura and Yamada, 2023). Honesty and transparency in AI content : Consumers increasingly value transpar&shy;ency regarding AI-generated content. Companies that openly disclose when AI has been used – for instance, in creating product descriptions – can empower customers by helping them feel more informed and in control of their choices. Such openness often strengthens customer trust and fosters positive perceptions of brands actively embracing transparency in their marketing practices. Cultural Variations In AI Trust The global nature of modern marketing requires a nuanced understanding of cultural differences in AI trust. These variations arise from deeply ingrained societal values, historical relationships with technology, and norms around privacy, automation, and decision-making. For marketers leveraging AI in customer engagement, recognizing these cultural distinctions is crucial for developing trustworthy AI-driven campaigns, personalized experiences, and region-specific data strategies. Diverging Cultural Trust In AI Research reveals significant disparities in AI trust across global markets. A KPMG (2023) global survey found that 72% of Chinese consumers express trust in AI-driven services, while in the U.S., trust levels plummet to just 32%. This stark difference reflects broader societal attitudes toward government-led AI innovation, data privacy concerns , and varying historical experiences with technology. Another study found that AI-related job displacement fears vary greatly by region. In countries like the U.S., India, and Saudi Arabia, consumers express significant concerns about AI replacing human roles in professional sectors such as medicine, finance, and law. In contrast, consumers in Japan, China, and Turkey exhibit lower levels of concern, signaling a higher acceptance of AI in professional settings (Quantum Zeitgeist, 2025). The Quantum Zeitgeist study shows that regions like Japan, China, and Turkey exhibit lower levels of concern about AI replacing human jobs compared to regions like the U.S., India, and Saudi Arabia, where such fears are more pronounced. This insight is invaluable for marketers crafting AI-driven customer service, finan&shy;cial tools, and healthcare applications, as perceptions of AI reliability and utility vary significantly by region. As trust in AI diverges globally, understanding the role of cultural privacy norms becomes essential for marketers aiming to build trust through AI-driven services. Cultural Privacy Targeting In AI Marketing As AI-driven marketing becomes more integrated globally, the concept of cultural privacy targeting – the practice of aligning data collection, privacy messaging, and AI transparency with cultural values – has gained increasing importance. Consumer attitudes toward AI adoption and data privacy are highly regional, requiring market&shy;ers to adapt their strategies accordingly. In more collectivist societies like Japan, AI applications that prioritize societal or community well-being are generally more accepted than those centered on individual convenience. This is evident in Japan&rsquo;s Society 5.0 initiative – a national vision intro&shy;duced in 2016 that seeks to build a &ldquo;super-smart&rdquo; society by integrating AI, IoT, robotics, and big data to solve social challenges such as an aging population and strains on healthcare systems. Businesses are central to this transformation, with government and industry collaboration encouraging companies to adopt digital technologies not just for efficiency, but to contribute to public welfare. Across sectors – from manufac&shy;turing and healthcare to urban planning – firms are reimagining business models to align with societal needs, creating innovations that are both economically viable and socially beneficial. In this context, AI is viewed more favorably when positioned as a tool to enhance collective well-being and address structural challenges. For instance, AI-powered health monitoring technologies in Japan have seen increased adoption when positioned as tools that contribute to broader public health outcomes. Conversely, Germany, as an individualistic society with strong privacy norms and high uncertainty avoidance, places significant emphasis on consumer control over personal data. The EU&rsquo;s GDPR and Germany&rsquo;s support for the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act reinforce expectations for robust transparency, fairness, and user autonomy in AI systems. According to the OECD (2024), campaigns in Germany that clearly communicate data usage, safeguard individual rights, and provide opt-in consent mechanisms experience higher levels of public trust and adoption. These contrasting cultural orientations illustrate the strategic need for contextual&shy;ized AI marketing – ensuring that data transparency and privacy are not treated as one-size-fits-all, but rather as culture-aware dimensions that shape trust and acceptance. Hofstede&rsquo;s (2011) cultural dimensions theory offers further insights into AI trust variations: High individualism + high uncertainty avoidance (e.g., Germany, U.S.) &rarr; Consum&shy;ers demand transparency, data protection, and human oversight in AI marketing. Collectivist cultures with lower uncertainty avoidance (e.g., Japan, China, South Korea) &rarr; AI is seen as a tool that enhances societal progress, and data-sharing concerns are often lower when the societal benefits are clear (Gupta et al., 2021). For marketers deploying AI in different regions, these insights help determine which features to emphasize: Control and explainability in Western markets (focused on privacy and auton&shy;omy). Seamless automation and societal progress in East Asian markets (focused on communal benefits and technological enhancement). Understanding the cultural dimensions of AI trust is key for marketers crafting successful AI-powered campaigns. By aligning AI personalization efforts with local cultural expectations and privacy norms, marketers can improve consumer trust and adoption in both individualistic and collectivist societies. This culturally informed approach helps brands tailor privacy messaging and AI transparency to the unique preferences of consumers in various regions, building stronger relationships and enhancing overall engagement. Avoiding Overgeneralization In AI Trust Strategies While cultural differences are clear, overgeneralizing consumer attitudes can lead to marketing missteps. A 2024 ISACA report warns against rigid AI segmentation, emphasizing that trust attitudes evolve with: Media influence (e.g., growing fears of AI misinformation). Regulatory changes (e.g., the EU AI Act&rsquo;s impact on European consumer confidence). Generational shifts (younger, digitally native consumers are often more AI-trusting, regardless of cultural background). For AI marketing, this highlights the need for flexible, real-time AI trust monitoring rather than static cultural assumptions. Marketers should adapt AI trust-building strategies based on region-specific consumer expectations: North America and Europe: AI explainability, data transparency, and ethical AI labels increase trust. East Asia: AI-driven personalization and seamless automation work best when framed as benefiting society. Islamic-majority nations and ethical consumer segments: AI must be clearly aligned with fairness and ethical governance. Global emerging markets: AI trust is rapidly increasing, making these markets prime opportunities for AI-driven financial inclusion and digital transformation. The data, drawn from the 2023 KPMG International survey, underscores how cultural values such as collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and openness to innovation, shape public attitudes toward AI. For example, trust levels in Germany and Japan remain low, reflecting high uncertainty avoidance and strong privacy expectations, while countries like India and Brazil exhibit notably higher trust, driven by optimism around AI&rsquo;s role in societal and economic progress. Measuring Trust In AI Marketing Systems As AI becomes central to how brands engage customers – from personalization engines to chatbots – measuring consumer trust in these systems is no longer optional. It&rsquo;s essential. And yet, many marketing teams still rely on outdated metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS) or basic satisfaction surveys to evaluate the impact of AI. These tools are helpful for broad feedback but miss the nuance and dynamics of trust in AI-powered experiences. Recent research, including work from MIT Media Lab (n.d.) and leading behavioral scientists, makes one thing clear: Trust in AI is multi-dimensional, and it&rsquo;s shaped by how people feel, think, and behave in real-time when interacting with automated systems. Traditional metrics like NPS and CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score) tell you if a customer is satisfied – but not why they trust (or don&rsquo;t trust) your AI systems. They don&rsquo;t account for how transparent your algorithm is, how well it explains itself, or how emotionally resonant the interaction feels. In AI-driven environments, you need a smarter way to understand trust. A Modern Framework For Trust: What CMOs Should Know MIT Media Lab&rsquo;s work on trust in human-AI interaction offers a powerful lens for marketers. It breaks trust into three key dimensions: Behavioral Trust This is about what customers do, not what they say. When customers engage frequently, opt in to data sharing, or return to your AI tools repeatedly, that&rsquo;s a sign of behavioral trust. How to track it: Repeat engagement with AI-driven tools (e.g., product recommenders, chatbots). Opt-in rates for personalization features. Drop-off points in AI-led journeys. Emotional Trust Trust is not just rational, it&rsquo;s emotional. The tone of a voice assistant, the empathy in a chatbot&rsquo;s reply, or how &ldquo;human&rdquo; a recommendation feels all play into emotional trust. How to track it: Sentiment analysis from chat transcripts and reviews. Customer frustration or delight signals from support tickets. Tone and emotional language in user feedback. Cognitive Trust This is where understanding meets confidence. When your AI explains itself clearly – or when customers understand what it can and can&rsquo;t do –they&rsquo;re more likely to trust the output. How to track it: Feedback on explainability (&ldquo;I understood why I got this recommendation&rdquo;). Click-through or acceptance rates of AI-generated content or decisions. Post-interaction surveys that assess clarity. Today&rsquo;s marketers are moving toward real-time trust dashboards – tools that moni&shy;tor how users interact with AI systems across channels. These dashboards track behavior, sentiment, and comprehension all at once. According to MIT Media Lab researchers, combining these signals provides a richer picture of trust than any single survey can. It also gives teams the agility to address trust breakdowns as they happen – like confusion over AI-generated content or friction in AI-powered customer journeys. Customers don&rsquo;t expect AI to be perfect. But they do expect it to be honest and understandable. That&rsquo;s why brands should: Label AI-generated content clearly. Explain how decisions like pricing, recommendations, or targeting are made. Give customers control over data and personalization. Building trust is less about tech perfection and more about perceived fairness, clarity, and respect. Measuring that trust means going deeper than satisfaction. Use behav&shy;ioral, emotional, and cognitive signals to track trust in real-time – and design AI systems that earn it.

News Perplexity is rolling out a game-changing move for the AI era: it’s offering publishers a cut of the revenue from AI-powered searches via its new Comet Plus subscription service. They've earmarked a $42.5 million pool, and publishers get a whopping 80% of revenues , while Perplexity retains just 20%. Why it matters: This is one of the first real attempts at fair AI–publisher cooperation—paying not just for licensing, but based on actual usage of their content in AI responses. It’s a direct counter to the “Google Zero” problem, where AI summaries steal traffic and value without compensating creators. Plus, it comes amid mounting legal pressure—Perplexity just lost a court bid in a News Corp lawsuit, pushing them toward solutions like this.

    "essence": "Search Engine Land » PPC » Article How to tell if Google Ads automation helps or hurts your campaigns Published: August 26, 2025 at 8:00 am Read Time: 8 minutes Share Written by Ameet Khabra Table of Contents Table of Contents Google Ads automation is powerful, but not foolproof. Learn the signs it’s on track – and the signals it’s steering performance wrong. Smart Bidding , Performance Max , and responsive search ads (RSAs) can all deliver efficiency, but only if they&rsquo;re optimizing for the right signals. The issue isn&rsquo;t that automation makes mistakes. It&rsquo;s that those mistakes compound over time. Left unchecked, that drift can quietly inflate your CPAs, waste spend, or flood your pipeline with junk leads. Automation isn&rsquo;t the enemy, though. The real challenge is knowing when it&rsquo;s helping and when it&rsquo;s hurting your campaigns. Here&rsquo;s how to tell. When automation is actually failing These are cases where automation isn&rsquo;t just constrained by your inputs. It&rsquo;s actively pushing performance in the wrong direction. Performance Max cannibalization The issue PMax often prioritizes cheap, easy traffic – especially branded queries or high-intent searches you intended to capture with Search campaigns. Even with brand exclusions, Google still serves impressions against brand queries, inflating reported performance and giving the illusion of efficiency. On top of that, when PMax and Search campaigns overlap, Google&rsquo;s auction rules give PMax priority, meaning carefully built Search campaigns can lose impressions they should own. A clear sign this is happening: if you see Search Lost IS (rank) rising in your Search campaigns while PMax spend increases, it&rsquo;s likely PMax is siphoning traffic. Recommendation Use brand exclusions and negatives in PMax to block queries you want Search to own. Segment brand and non-brand campaigns so you can track each cleanly. And to monitor branded traffic specifically, tools like the PMax Brand Traffic Analyzer (by Smarter Ecommerce) can help. Dig deeper: Performance Max vs. Search campaigns: New data reveals substantial search term overlap Auto-applied recommendations (AAR) rewriting structure The issue AARs can quietly restructure your campaigns without you even noticing. This includes: Adding broad match keywords. &ldquo;Upgrading&rdquo; existing keywords to broader match types. Adding new keywords that are sometimes irrelevant to your targeting. Google has framed these &ldquo;optimizations&rdquo; as efficiency improvements, but the issue is that they can destabilize performance. Broad keywords open the door to irrelevant queries, which then can spike CPA and waste budget. Recommendation First, opt out of AARs and manually review all recommendations moving forward. Second, audit the changes that have already been made by going to Campaigns > Recommendations > Auto Apply > History. From there, you can see what change happened on what date, which allows you to go back to your campaign data and see if there are any performance correlations. Dig deeper: Top Google Ads recommendations you should always ignore, use, or evaluate Modeled conversions inflating numbers The issue Modeled conversions can climb while real sales or MQLs stay flat. For example, you may see a surge in reported leads or purchases in your ads account, but when you look at your CRM, the numbers don&rsquo;t match up. This happens because Google uses modeling to estimate conversions where direct measurement isn&rsquo;t possible. If Google doesn&rsquo;t have full tracking, it fills gaps by estimating conversions it can&rsquo;t directly track, based on patterns in observable data. When left unchecked, the automation will double down on these patterns (because it assumes they&rsquo;re correct), wasting budget on traffic that looks good but won&rsquo;t convert. Recommendation Tell the automation what matters most to your business. Import offline or qualified conversions (via Enhanced Conversions , manual uploads, or CRM integration). This will ensure that Google optimizes for real revenue and not modeled noise. When automation is boxed in: Reading the signals Not every warning in Google means automation is failing. Sometimes the system is limited by the goals, budget, or inputs you&rsquo;ve set – and it&rsquo;s simply flagging that. These diagnostic signals help you understand when to adjust your setup instead of blaming the algorithm. Limited statuses (red vs. yellow) The issue A Limited status doesn&rsquo;t always mean your campaign is broken. If you see a red Limited label, this means your settings are too strict. That could mean that your CPA or ROAS targets are unrealistic, your budget is too low, etc. Seeing a yellow Limited label is more of a caution sign. It&rsquo;s usually tied to low volume, limited data, or the campaign is still learning. Recommendation If the status is red, loosen constraints gradually: raise your budget and ease up CPA/ROAS targets by 10–15%. If the status is yellow, don&rsquo;t panic. This is Google&rsquo;s version of telling you that they could use more money, if possible, but it&rsquo;s not vital to your campaign&rsquo;s success. Responsive search ads (RSAs) inputs The issue RSAs are built in real-time from the headlines and descriptions you have already provided Google. At a minimum, advertisers are required to write 3 headlines with a maximum of 15 (and up to 4 descriptions). The fewer the assets you give the system, the less flexibility it will have. On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re running a small budget and give the RSAs all 15 headlines and 4 descriptions, there is no way Google will be able to collect enough data to figure out which combinations actually work. The automation isn&rsquo;t failing with either. You&rsquo;ve either given it too little information or too much with too little spending. Recommendation Match asset volume to the budget allocated to the campaign. If you&rsquo;re unsure, aim to write between 8-10 headlines and 2-4 descriptions. If each headline/description isn&rsquo;t distinct, don&rsquo;t use it. Conversion reporting lag and attribution issues The issue Sometimes, Google Ads reports fewer conversions than your business actually sees. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily an automation failure. It&rsquo;s often just a matter of when the conversion is counted. By default, Google reports conversions on the day of the click, not the day the actual conversion happened. That means if you check performance mid-week, you might see fewer conversions than your campaign has actually generated because Google attributes them back to the click date. The data usually &ldquo;catches up&rdquo; as lagging conversions are processed. Recommendation Use the Conversions (by conversion time) column alongside the standard conversion column. This helps you separate true performance drops from simple reporting delays. If discrepancies persist beyond a few days, investigate the tracking setup or import accuracy. Just don&rsquo;t assume automation is broken just because of timing gaps. Get the newsletter search marketers rely on. See terms. Where to look in the Google Ads UI Automation leaves a clear trail within Google Ads if you know where to look. Here are some reports and columns to help spot when automation is drifting. Bid Strategy report: Top signals The issue The bid strategy report shows some of the signals Smart Bidding relies on when there is enough data. The &ldquo;top signals&rdquo; can sometimes make sense, and at other times, they can be a bit misleading. If the algorithm relies on weak signals (e.g., broad search themes and a lack of first-party data), its optimizations will be weak, too. Recommendation Make checking your Top Signals a regular activity. If they don&rsquo;t align with your business, fix the inputs. Improve conversion tracking. Import offline conversions. Reevaluate search themes. Add customer/remarketing lists. Expand your negative keyword list(s). Impression share metrics The issue When a campaign underdelivers, it&rsquo;s tempting to assume automation is failing, but looking at Impression Share (IS) metrics tends to reveal the real bottleneck. By looking at Search Lost IS (budget), Search Lost IS (rank), and Absolute Top IS together, you can separate automation problems from structural or competitive ones. How to use IS metrics as a diagnostic tool. Budget problem High Lost IS (budget) + low Lost IS (rank) : Your campaign isn&rsquo;t struggling. It just doesn&rsquo;t have enough budget to run properly. Recommendation: Raise the budget or accept capped volume. Targets too aggressive High Lost IS (rank) + low Absolute Top IS : If your Lost IS (rank) is high and your budget is adequate, your CPA/ROAS targets are likely too aggressive, causing Smart Bidding to underbid in auctions. Recommendation: Loosen targets gradually (10-15%). Scripts to keep automation honest Scripts give you early warnings so you can step in before wasted spend piles up. Anomaly detection The issue: Automation can suddenly overspend or underspend when conditions in the marketplace change, but you often won&rsquo;t notice until reporting lags. Recommendation: Use an anomaly detection script to flag unusual swings in spend, clicks, or conversions so you can investigate quickly. Query quality (N-gram analysis) The issue: Broad match and PMax can drift into irrelevant themes (&ldquo;free,&rdquo; &ldquo;jobs,&rdquo; &ldquo;definition&rdquo;), wasting budget on low-quality queries. Recommendation: Run an N-gram script to surface recurring poor-quality terms and add them as negatives before automation optimizes toward them. Budget pacing The issue: Google won&rsquo;t exceed your monthly cap, but daily spend will be uneven. Pacing scripts help you spot front-loading. Recommendation: A pacing script shows you how spend is distributed so you can adjust daily budgets mid-month or hold back funds when performance is weak. Turning automation into an asset Automation rarely fails in dramatic ways – it drifts. Your job isn&rsquo;t to fight it, but to supervise it: Supply the right signals. Track when it goes off course. Step in before wasted spend compounds. The diagnostics we covered – impression share, attribution checks, PMax insights, and scripts – help you separate real failures from cases where automation is simply following your inputs.

    "essence": "Search Engine Land » PPC » Article Global expansion and hyperlocal focus redefine the next chapter of retail media networks Published: August 26, 2025 at 7:00 am Read Time: 7 minutes Share Written by DoorDash Table of Contents Table of Contents As retail media networks mature, success hinges on mastering both global scale and neighborhood-level precision. Retail media networks are projected to be worth $179.5 billion by 2025 , but capturing share and achieving long-term success won&rsquo;t hinge solely on growing their customer base. With over 200 retail media networks now competing for advertiser attention, the landscape has become increasingly complex and crowded. The RMNs that stand out will be those taking a differentiated approach to meeting the evolving needs of advertisers. The industry&rsquo;s concentration creates interesting dynamics. While some platforms have achieved significant scale, nearly 70% of RMN buyers cite &ldquo;complexity in the buying process&rdquo; as their biggest obstacle. That tension, between explosive growth and operational complexity, is forcing the industry to evolve beyond traditional approaches. As the landscape matures, which strategies will define the next wave of growth: global expansion, hyperlocal targeting, or both? The evolution of retail media platforms To understand where the industry is heading, it&rsquo;s worth examining how successful platforms are addressing advertisers&rsquo; core challenges. Lack of measurement standards across platforms continues to frustrate advertisers who want to compare performance across networks. Manual processes dominate smaller networks , making campaign management inefficient and time-consuming. At the same time, most retailers lack the digital footprint necessary for standalone success. This has created opportunities for platforms that can solve multiple problems simultaneously: standardization, automation, and scale. DoorDash represents an interesting case study in this evolution. The platform has built its advertising capabilities around reaching consumers at their moment of local need across multiple categories. With more than 42 million monthly active consumers as of December 2024, DoorDash provides scale and access to high-intent shoppers across various categories spanning restaurants, groceries and retail. The company&rsquo;s approach demonstrates how platforms can address advertiser pain points through technology. DoorDash&rsquo;s recent platform announcement showcases this evolution: the company now serves advertisers with new AI-powered tools and expanded capabilities. Through its acquisition of ad tech platform Symbiosys, a next-generation retail media platform, brands can expand their reach into digital channels, such as search, social, and display, and retailers can extend the breadth of their retail media networks. Global expansion meets local precision International expansion presents both opportunities and challenges for retail media networks. Europe&rsquo;s retail media industry is projected to surpass &euro;31 billion by 2028 ,. This creates opportunities for networks that can solve the technology puzzle of operating across multiple geographies. The challenge lies in building platforms that work seamlessly across countries while maintaining local relevance. International expansion requires handling different currencies, regulations, and cultural contexts—capabilities that many networks struggle to develop. DoorDash&rsquo;s acquisition of Wolt illustrates how platforms can achieve global scale while maintaining local connections. The integration enables brands to manage campaigns across Europe and the U.S. through a single interface—exactly the kind of operational efficiency that overwhelmed advertisers seek. The combined entity now operates across more than 30 countries, with DoorDash and Wolt Ads crossing an annualized advertising revenue run rate of more than $1 billion in 2024. What makes this expansion compelling isn&rsquo;t just the scale—it&rsquo;s how the integration maintains neighborhood-level precision across diverse geographies. Wolt has transformed from a food delivery platform into what it describes as a multi-category &ldquo;shopping mall in people&rsquo;s pockets.&rdquo; The hyperlocal advantage: context beats demographics Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really changing the game: the shift from demographic targeting to contextual precision. Privacy regulations favor contextual targeting over behavioral tracking, but that&rsquo;s not the only reason smart networks are going hyperlocal. Location-based intent signals provide dramatically higher conversion probability than traditional demographics. Real-time contextual data—weather patterns, local events, proximity to fulfillment—influences purchase decisions in immediate, actionable ways that broad demographic targeting simply can&rsquo;t match. DoorDash built its entire advertising model around this insight, reaching consumers at the exact moment of local need across multiple categories. The platform provides scale and access to high-intent shoppers with contextual precision. A recent innovation that exemplifies this approach is Dayparting for CPG brands , which enables advertisers to target users in their local time zones—a level of time-based precision that distinguishes hyperlocal platforms from broader retail media networks. In one example , Unilever applied Dayparting to focus on late-night and weekend windows for its ice cream campaigns, aligning ad delivery with peak demand periods. Over a two-week period, 77% of attributed sales were new-to-brand, demonstrating the power of contextual timing in driving incremental reach. Major brands, including Unilever, Coca-Cola, and Heineken, utilize both DoorDash and Wolt platforms for hyperlocal targeting, proving the model is effective for both endemic and non-endemic advertisers seeking neighborhood-level precision. Technology evolution: measurement and automation The technical requirements for next-generation retail media networks extend far beyond basic advertising capabilities. Self-serve functionality has become standard for international geographies—not because it&rsquo;s trendy, but because manual campaign management doesn&rsquo;t scale across dozens of countries with different currencies, regulations, and cultural contexts. Cross-country campaign management requires unified dashboards that manage complexity while maintaining simplicity for advertisers. Automation isn&rsquo;t optional anymore; it&rsquo;s necessary to compete with established players who&rsquo;ve built machine learning into their core operations. But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really transforming measurement: new attribution methodologies that go beyond traditional ROAS. When platforms can integrate fulfillment data with advertising exposure, they enable real-time performance tracking that connects ad spend to actual business outcomes rather than just clicks and impressions. Progress on standardization continues through IAB guidelines addressing measurement consistency , alongside industry pushes for technical integration standards. The challenge lies in balancing standardization with differentiation—networks need to offer easy integration and consistent measurement while maintaining unique value propositions. In a move toward addressing advertisers&rsquo; need for measurement consistency, DoorDash recognized that restaurant brands valued both click and impression-based attribution for their sponsored listing ads, and recently introduced impression-based attribution and reporting in Ads Manager . This has enabled restaurant brands to gain a deeper understanding of performance and results driven on DoorDash. Global technology challenges add another layer of complexity: multi-currency transactions, local payment methods, regulatory compliance across countries, and cultural adaptation while maintaining platform consistency. These aren&rsquo;t afterthoughts for international platforms, they&rsquo;re core competencies that determine success or failure. Industry outlook: consolidation and opportunity Retail media is heading toward consolidation, but not in the way most people expect. Hyperlocal networks are positioned to capture share from undifferentiated RMNs that compete solely on inventory volume. Geographic specialization is becoming a viable alternative to traditional scale-focused approaches. Simultaneously, community impact measurement is gaining importance for brand strategy. Marketers are discovering that advertising dollars spent on local commerce platforms create multiplier effects—supporting neighborhood businesses and strengthening local economies in ways that traditional e-commerce advertising doesn&rsquo;t achieve. The networks that understand this dynamic, that can offer global platform capabilities with genuine local industry expertise, are the ones positioned to define retail media&rsquo;s next chapter. Success requires technology integration that enables contextual and location-based targeting, plus measurement solutions that prove incrementality beyond traditional metrics. The path forward As retail media networks mature, success lies not in choosing between global scale and local relevance, but in achieving both simultaneously.

Download the Free Templates Updated: 08/26/25 A few years ago, I was in charge of presenting a big marketing strategy deck to a senior executive. My team and I prepared a script that went something like this: “In Q3, we’ll deliver a unified editorial calendar. Subject matter will reinforce key audience pain points. We will increase paid media investments to leverage this series in integrated campaigns.” It sounded so impressive in my head, but the executive just wanted clarity. She asked, “So, what is it exactly? A blog series we promote in paid?” Oops. In that moment, I realized the words I was using were all wrong. I wasn’t just doing this in meetings. I was adopting this voice in all the brand’s content I was creating, too. I call that jargon-filled approach “content voice.” And since that meeting, I’ve been on a mission to stop its spread — both in my work and at other brands. Let’s break down exactly what content voice means and how to avoid it, along with some real examples of brands that get it right. Table of Contents What is content voice? Your voice should feel like a distinct logo. 5 Tips for Developing a Strong & Cohesive Brand Voice Examples of a Strong Brand Voice What is content voice? Content voice is when brands use fancy-sounding jargon in the content they create for their audience instead of communicating simply. Here’s what it looks like IRL. @heike.young I’m so embarrassed of my work voice. When I’m WFH and someone hears it, I feel like I’m wearing a little monocle 💀 Does your corporate self wear a monocle too or are you normal? #corporate #corporatelife ♬ original sound - Heike Young 🤓 When I posted about content voice on LinkedIn , my comments section exploded with people who knew exactly what I meant. Content voice is saying “utilize” or “leverage” instead of “use.” It’s customers reading multiple paragraphs about what your product does but still not understanding it. When you read something written in content voice, you can tell it’s marketing content, making it feel less personal and valuable. In my experience, speaking in your regular, non-content voice is a much better bet. Sticking to a clear, accessible voice for your brand is critical to make sure your internal and external stakeholders actually understand what you’re talking about. Instead of complicated, inaccessible language, just use the same words you’d use to explain your idea to a friend over coffee. I know this might seem tough, especially in B2B. But your customers will thank you for explaining things clearly. At the end of the day, we’re all human, so there’s no need to talk like a robot. Instead, just use regular, jargon-free words, and do your best to communicate as clearly (and as humanly) as possible.

You're all set! Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now Your voice should feel like a distinct logo. So, you’ve cut all the jargon out of your style guide. That’s just the first step. Goodbye, content voice. From there, you have to build a brand voice that feels distinct in a sea of sameness. Your brand voice should feel like a logo, memorable and distinct. Any time I interact with your brand, I should automatically recognize it from the words you use. Your brand voice should be authentic to your offering and your audience. And it should span your social channels, blog content, company podcasts, and newsletters. Ideally, I’d be able to say, “I’d recognize that voice anywhere.” 5 Tips for Developing a Strong & Cohesive Brand Voice How do you actually develop a voice like that? Here are some tried-and-true tips to help marketers develop a strong and cohesive brand voice. 1. Listen to understand. Especially as a junior marketer, I often assumed that the point of communicating was to sound smart. It didn’t matter if I had no idea what I was talking about, as long as I sounded impressive. But to develop a brand voice that’s clear and intelligible, it’s essential to actually understand the subject matter. And, that starts with really listening. So, when interviewing leaders or customers, ask plenty of questions. Don’t be afraid to ask the same thing multiple times to get the information you need. Then, once you really understand their answers, you can use that understanding to communicate more effectively. 2. Define niche terms. In general, it’s best to use simple language that everyone can easily understand. But of course, you can’t always avoid niche terms. When an industry-specific term is necessary, it’s okay to use it. Just remember to define the term, rather than assuming that everyone will already know what it means. You can define the same term in multiple pieces of content. Don’t assume everyone’s read everything you create. 3. Advocate for your audience. Talking like a regular person may not seem all that counterintuitive, but I’ve found that sooner or later, you’re likely to run into some pushback. Whether it’s an overzealous colleague or an old-fashioned senior executive, it’s not uncommon for marketers to find themselves dealing with people trying to edit their work to make it more jargon-y. If and when that happens, it’s vital to serve as an advocate for your audience. Of course, this conversation can be uncomfortable (even more so if it’s with your boss or someone who has a lot more experience than you). But if you explain that you’re just trying to make the content as clear as possible, then you should be able to get the buy-in you need. That’s especially true for global audiences, many of whom may natively speak a different language than you do. Those folks will definitely appreciate when you avoid jargon-filled copy. 4. Use data to back up your approach. Beyond just explaining that using regular language will naturally help more people understand what you’re saying, I bet you can also find data to support the benefits of this approach. The metrics that matter most will depend on your unique industry and business context, but see if you can find evidence proving that using a regular voice leads to more time spent on your website, higher conversion rates, and other valuable improvements. In general, I’m guessing if you test regular voice vs. content voice website headings or landing page copy, the regular voice will win. 5. Lead by example. Finally, if you’re in a leadership role, be proactive about your brand’s voice and tone. After all, junior writers and editors will be emulating you. If you use pompous, confusing language, they’ll get the message that sounding fancy is the way to succeed. But if you talk like a regular person, people will naturally follow your lead. In addition, make sure to praise marketers for using clear language. When reviewing their content, always look for opportunities to simplify. You can also formalize brand voice guidelines, explicitly encouraging people to avoid corporate jargon and prioritize accessibility. But of course, people will only follow those rules if they see their leaders sticking to them, too. Even if you’re not in a leadership role, you can still lead by example, though, and make a push inside your company for clearer language. Examples of a Strong Brand Voice So, what does this look like in practice? Here are a few examples of brands using a strong, clear voice without sounding pretentious. Mailchimp: Striking the Balance Between Business and Pleasure B2B brands have a tough mission. They need to be distinct and have personality while selling technical solutions. How can you possibly showcase a B2B offering without using jargon? Mailchimp finds a way. The email marketing and automation platform strikes the right balance between helpful content and vibe. Its how-to guides give real steps that can help marketers create effective email campaigns, all while keeping jargon to a minimum. On social, Mailchimp continues to lead with value, like in their LinkedIn carousels that offer deep, but brief, insights for the audience. Source The Hustle: The No-BS Approach to Business Newsletter The Hustle offers business news without content voice. The publication offers a “no-BS source for the business stories that matter.” All of the brand’s content — from social media posts to the newsletter itself — has the same conversational tone. The brand‘s personality shines through in their subject lines too, with headers like, “Why everyone’s suddenly obsessed with pickleball.” I see something punchy in my inbox and want to click through. And, once I get to the content, I know that I won’t need an MBA to understand it. Canva: Keeping the Product Fun, Front, and Center When I think of graphic design, I think creativity, fun, and finding clever ways to showcase a product. Canva captures that spirit. Instead of defaulting to content voice, the brand has a straightforward and casual tone. There’s no mention of in-the-weeds features. Canva just lets the product do the talking. That approach is all over the brand’s copy, whether that’s on LinkedIn or billboards. Source Source When it comes to brand voice, simpler is better. At the end of the day, I’ve learned that simpler is almost always better. While niche terms have their place, putting on a fancy-sounding “content voice” tends to backfire: Instead of sounding smart, you just sound like you’re marketing something complicated. Instead, I always recommend that marketers focus on clarity. That means using simple words and prioritizing accessibility. And when in doubt, just try to sound like a human.

Comet AI Browser Vulnerability Brave described a vulnerability that can be activated when a user asks the Comet AI browser to summarize a web page. The LLM will read the web page, including any embedded prompts that command the LLM to take action on any open tabs According to Brave: &ldquo;The vulnerability we&rsquo;re discussing in this post lies in how Comet processes webpage content: when users ask it to &ldquo;Summarize this webpage,&rdquo; Comet feeds a part of the webpage directly to its LLM without distinguishing between the user&rsquo;s instructions and untrusted content from the webpage. This allows attackers to embed indirect prompt injection payloads that the AI will execute as commands. For instance, an attacker could gain access to a user&rsquo;s emails from a prepared piece of text in a page in another tab.&rdquo; A post on Simon Willison&rsquo;s Weblog shared that Perplexity tried to patch the vulnerability but the fix does not work. A developer posted the following on X: &ldquo;Why is no one talking about this? This is why I don&rsquo;t use an AI browser You can literally get prompt injected and your bank account drained by doomscrolling on reddit:&rdquo; Things aren&rsquo;t looking good for Comet Browser at this time.

Everyone who tested it loves it. MVP is running and the whole technical side is complete. Now the marketing starts. For me this is the hardest part as I’m a maker, not a marketeer. I’ve got €600 left. So I thought Facebook ads. But my target demographic is 200.000.000 according to Facebook. So with €600 I won’t get far. It’s probably not enough for Facebook to get the algorithm running and see which people are most likely to buy my product. I tried contacting influencers. But they also all want money up front. (Just being a 40% affiliate is not enough for them). And paying €150 for 2 stories on a micro influencer page seems ridiculous to me. I’m willing to give part of the company to an investor, but only like 20%-30% max. But getting investors online is also very expensive. Those dedicated websites all cost like €2k a month.

Members Online • Ketul-Sindhwad Yesterday we discussed AI Agents — here’s what I’ve learned (and the next big question) Discussion Yesterday I posted about AI Agents as the “employees” of the future, and the responses were amazing. Some of you shared how you’re already testing agents in marketing, automation, and even customer support. Others raised valid concerns about reliability, cost, and control. After going through the comments, I realized one key takeaway: ➡️ The real power of AI Agents isn’t just in replacing one task, but in orchestrating multiple tasks together like a mini digital workforce. That got me thinking about the next step: Instead of single-task agents, what happens when we have multi-agent systems working together? Could we see companies running like “digital organizations” where agents act as a content team, marketing team, and ops team — all coordinating automatically? And if that happens… what roles do humans play? Strategy only? Creativity? Oversight? I’d love to keep the discussion going: 👉 Do you think multi-agent collaboration is realistic in the next 2–3 years, or is this still a long-term dream? 👉 What real-world barriers do you see (tech limits, trust, legal issues, etc.)? Looking forward to your thoughts — yesterday’s thread was 🔥 and I’m excited to dive deeper with all of you. Read more Share",

We love to say #MadeInIndia until it comes to actually using Indian apps. The moment an Indian alternative launches, there’s either silence or instant skepticism. Meanwhile, people abroad back their homegrown products effortlessly and with pride. That’s what pushed us to build something new: Vokal India. It’s Aadhaar-verified, secure, and built for Indians. No shady logins, no random data leaks just a platform that puts trust first. We didn’t make this because it was trendy. We made it because we were done waiting for someone else to solve it. Right now, we’re testing it out with a small circle and looking for genuine feedback. So here’s my ask what do you think stops us from supporting Indian tech the way others support theirs?

Question I have been a marketing coordinator for three to four years in the commercial real estate space, working for two companies, one local and one international. I really want to transition into retail or product marketing, especially in beauty, but I am struggling with how to present my CRE marketing experience in a way that would catch the attention of a retail or consumer brand. Personally, much of CRE marketing is email-focused, and our audience is not really on Instagram or TikTok, making it difficult to show analytics or results that would impress someone outside the industry. Has anyone successfully moved from CRE to retail or product marketing? How did you frame your experience to make it relevant? Read more Share",

I’m in a place where I understand the career path I want (marketing director) to take with it but I’ve been hearing some bad things about the industry (being laid off, not worth the pay, etc). I’ve been thinking about moving into a business major but don’t want to give up a degree in something that I want to do if it will actually benefit me. I’m mostly concerned I won’t make enough to be comfortable or I’ll be miserable doing the work, if that’s the cause I’d rather go for a higher paying job even if it does make me miserable you know? If you could suggest a better major that isn’t medical related I’d appreciate it. Tldr: is it worth it to go into this industry anymore? Read more Share",

    "essence": "Search Engine Land » PPC » Article Google Ads expands PMax Channel Reporting to account level Published: August 25, 2025 at 4:42 pm Read Time: 1 minute Share Written by Anu Adegbola Table of Contents Table of Contents Advertisers can now spot cross-campaign trends and performance patterns in PMax with a single account-level view. Performance Max (PMax) advertisers just got a major visibility upgrade: Channel Reporting is now available at the account level, not just within individual campaigns. How it works: View and compare all PMax campaigns in a single reporting overview. Segment by conversion metrics to understand what&rsquo;s driving results. Identify performance patterns across channels without jumping campaign to campaign. Why we care. Until now, channel performance data was siloed within each PMax campaign. The new account-level reporting makes it easier to spot trends, compare results, and optimize across campaigns. The big picture. Google notes that channel data is available for PMax campaigns &ldquo;at this time&rdquo; — a phrasing that suggests the feature could expand to other campaign types down the road. Bottom line. More visibility, less friction. This change gives advertisers a faster, more complete view of PMax performance — and hints at broader reporting upgrades ahead. First seen.

    "essence": "Go to digital_marketing r/digital_marketing • Puzzleheaded_Size447 Lead Magnet Vs. Direct to Booking - Which makes more sense? To give some context I am a franchise broker (think a realtor but for franchise businesses), my broad target demo are people who want to buy a franchise and are currently in the 'investigative stage' where they are ready to make a move in the next 1-3 months if they found 'the right' model. I'm advertising on Meta ($6k/mo ad spend) with a small agency (this guys is definitely good and knows what he is doing in terms of getting on-paper qualified leads through the campaign). Our current ad method is to pick one of the high performing franchises we have, advertise it like the actual brand would, but we don't disclose the name (because if we did they could just go directly to the brand and I would never know/wouldn't get paid). So they have to come to me, and on our call we go through what they're looking for, if the industry is even a fit for them, and then I can schedule a follow up call to go through multiple options that fit as good if not better for what they're looking for. With that said, I am at a little bit of a crossroad with how the marketing is going. As I've talked with these leads, they tend to be very hesitant coming onto the call since they don't know what franchise we're referencing, and then when they get on they're primarily looking for info on the specific franchise we were advertising for. **Now I'm not ignorant to how actual sales works, and know that you need to be asking good, deeper level motivation questions to be able to sell effectively. This is a skillset I'm actively developing** With this said, I'm big into Alex Hormozi's content and am reading his $100M Leads again, and am hung up on his idea of 'lead magnet' to either uncover a problem they didn't know they had, or solves one step in a multistep process to encourage them to then book a call after providing a good amount of value. This is especially true for high ticket items like what I do. With our current ad method, we are doing the 'direct offer/book call' instead of providing any value up front to build trust and rapport with the lead before they book the call. I really see where Alex is coming from to get higher quality engaged leads with his 'value/lead magnet' first, then show them how its hard, then finally offer them to book a call. With the current lead production, it seems like I'll just have to become a dog of a sales person (not with 'tricks' but with actual skill) which I can imagine is going to take years of reps to harness. I guess my question comes down to this- Do I just take on that task of becoming this elite level sales guy and figure it out? Or try to build a more 'Hormozi' style ad campaign where people are coming into the call more receptive and open to the conversation (...while also becoming an elite level salesperson along the way)?

    "essence": "Go to marketing r/marketing • Acceptable-Energy425 Marketing Remote Work Platforms: A Different Kind of Challenge I’ve been thinking about how marketing shifts when your product is about people instead of a product . For example: platforms that connect companies with remote talent in Latin America. Unlike SaaS or consumer products where you focus heavily on features, here the “product” is the people themselves — their skills, availability, and trustworthiness. That makes the brand narrative very different: You’re not just selling efficiency, you’re selling credibility and dignity in the hiring process. You’re not just talking cost savings, you’re also tackling biases about remote/nearshore work . And instead of a product demo, the “proof” is the actual match between company and talent. So here’s my question to the group: 👉 When marketing something where the people are the product **, how would you approach differentiation?** Focus on trust signals? Emotional storytelling? Hard ROI? Curious to hear how others here would frame this kind of marketing challenge. Read more Share",

Members Online • Ketul-Sindhwad What exactly are AI Agents and how are they shaping the future of business & marketing? Discussion Hey everyone, Lately, I’ve been diving deep into the concept of AI Agents and I feel like this space is going to explode in the next few years. From what I understand, AI Agents are basically autonomous programs powered by AI models (like GPTs) that can reason, plan, and take actions on their own to achieve a specific goal. Unlike a regular chatbot that just answers queries, these agents can: • Gather data from different sources • Make decisions based on logic + past inputs • Trigger actions like sending emails, scraping data, or updating CRMs • Even collaborate with other AI agents for complex workflows In marketing & business automation, I’m already seeing use cases like: • Automating SEO tasks (keyword research, content briefs, backlink outreach) • Running personalized ad campaigns with zero human touch • Handling customer support with multi-step reasoning • Managing sales pipelines end-to-end It feels like we’re moving from “AI as an assistant” → to “AI as an employee.” 🔹 Do you think AI Agents will replace traditional SaaS tools in the near future? 🔹 Anyone here experimenting with them in real projects (marketing, e-commerce, ops)? 🔹 Which frameworks/platforms are you using (Auto-GPT, CrewAI, LangChain, etc.)? Would love to hear your thoughts and real-world experiences. Read more Share",

    "essence": "Search Engine Land » SEO » Article Why community is the antidote to AI overload in search marketing Published: August 25, 2025 at 9:00 am Read Time: 7 minutes Share Written by Ashley Liddell Table of Contents Table of Contents In a world where AI-generated answers sound the same, community-driven trust gives brands individuality, credibility, and lasting preference. In 2025, people aren&rsquo;t just searching for answers anymore. They&rsquo;re looking for genuine responses from the people they trust most: Creators. Communities. Fellow brand supporters. In many ways, community has become an algorithm of its own. AI-powered tools like Google Gemini , ChatGPT , and Perplexity have made knowledge more accessible than ever. But in doing so, they&rsquo;ve also flattened it. Answers feel repetitive, citations pull from the same limited sources, and brand voices risk becoming interchangeable. That&rsquo;s where community comes in. While generative AI commoditizes information, community restores individuality. It offers what no model can compress into tokens: Authentic connection. Lived experience. Trust. When democratized information becomes homogenized I can still remember when Google – and later YouTube – made information feel democratized, putting knowledge at our fingertips like never before. But with the rise of AI, that same accessibility now comes at a cost: everything starts to sound the same. Every brand competing for similar keywords risks becoming interchangeable, sounding the same in AI-generated summaries that deliver information without distinction. Meanwhile, authority is concentrated into a small set of repeatedly cited sources, so users encounter little variation in what LLMs surface. In some ways, this is similar to traditional SEO . But there&rsquo;s an important difference: websites once gave us the chance to &ldquo;get our brand over&rdquo; and show what made our solution unique. That&rsquo;s what feels lost in an AI-driven search experience. Still, within this sameness lies opportunity. While brands fight for visibility inside an AI Overview, those with the strongest communities can not just stand apart – but truly stand alone. Dig deeper: SEO for user activation, retention and community Community as the differentiator AI responses are built around compression – getting audiences to an answer as quickly and concisely as possible. Community, on the other hand, expands. AI platforms tend to generalize first, then personalize only when prompted. Community works the opposite way: it personalizes from the start. In my view, that&rsquo;s the kind of user experience audiences will ultimately prefer – and it&rsquo;s how brands will become the choice within their niche. Think about: A Reddit thread that discusses your product specifically. That&rsquo;s not just another citation. It&rsquo;s a living testimonial, open to being challenged or reinforced in real time. A Discord server filled with engaged users doesn&rsquo;t just provide customer support – it showcases the culture and identity your brand is building. Social comment threads around a creator&rsquo;s content show personality, emotion, and authenticity that no LLM can replicate. Ultimately, your community gives your brand the one thing AI can&rsquo;t compress or flatten into tokens: individuality. In a world of sameness, community is what gives your brand its voice back. UGC? Hello, UGT! User-generated content (UGC) has long been viewed as central to search marketing – a key driver of discoverability. That&rsquo;s still true, but the conversation has matured. It&rsquo;s no longer just about &ldquo;content.&rdquo; What truly matters now is user-generated trust (UGT). This may sound like a subtle mindset shift, but it changes everything. Search marketing teams should focus on the real, ongoing conversations within communities that validate products and learn how to leverage those conversations wherever possible. That&rsquo;s where genuine user advocacy emerges. And it&rsquo;s advocacy that increasingly shows up in SERPs and AI responses. Whether it&rsquo;s a YouTube video featured in search results, a Reddit thread highlighted in an AI answer, or a TikTok creator&rsquo;s series, UGT creates organic momentum. It sends signals to both people and algorithms that your brand is credible, trustworthy, and the preferred choice. Backlinks can be gamed, and citations scraped or manufactured. UGC is about output. And UGT? It&rsquo;s about advocacy and credibility – and that&rsquo;s exactly what search marketing teams need to drive lasting results. Dig deeper: Advanced tactics to maximize the SEO value of user-generated content Get the newsletter search marketers rely on. See terms. How owned and earned communities build trust When thinking about your brand community, there are two key considerations. Owned communities These are spaces where conversations and culture consistently reinforce or evolve your positioning and shape how you&rsquo;re perceived. They include: Brand Discord channels. Slack groups. Reddit forums. Earned communities These are the building blocks your brand participates in – where authenticity can either strengthen or undermine trust. Think of: Reddit threads not owned by your brand. Facebook groups. Quora discussions. Comment threads. Other spaces where people gather independently. Both owned and earned communities play a critical role in the smartest strategies. By seeding and nurturing conversations where your community and broader audience already gather. By cultivating a &ldquo;home&rdquo; that is uniquely yours, you protect your brand against the homogenizing effect of AI-driven search. Dig deeper: The rise of forums: Why Google prefers them and how to adapt Why community is the secret sauce of search everywhere Here&rsquo;s a sobering thought: AI is only going to get better. They&rsquo;ll become more skilled at surfacing consensus and amplifying shared rhetoric. But consensus doesn&rsquo;t drive differentiation. Community does. A backlink can be replicated. A feature in a listicle can be matched. That&rsquo;s just search marketing ping-pong. A community, on the other hand, can&rsquo;t be scraped, cloned, or copied. Brands that invest in their communities today aren&rsquo;t just building engagement. They&rsquo;re building something much more powerful: a moat of differentiation and individuality. Community resists the sameness of AI-driven search. It&rsquo;s what ensures your brand&rsquo;s voice doesn&rsquo;t just show up, but truly stands out. LEGO Ideas: Community in action One brand that proves the power of community as a competitive advantage – especially in an AI-driven world – is LEGO. Through its LEGO Ideas platform, the company has turned its community into a creative engine for product ideation and a discovery layer that informs both content and product development. Fans submit their ideas and vote on their favorites. The best and most popular are turned into real products. Everything from pop culture tie-ins (recently, a Wallace and Gromit set was greenlit) to architectural replicas has emerged through this process. So why is this powerful from a search perspective? There are two key reasons. Authenticity at scale, organically Every submission, vote, and comment is UGT in action. The community validates which ideas deserve attention, creating a visible signal of credibility long before a set hits the shelves. Fan conversations fuel visibility The conversations, forums, and social amplification around these fan-led projects fuel organic visibility. A single fan concept can spark thousands of blog posts, Reddit threads, YouTube videos, and TikToks – surfacing LEGO in contexts no AI citation list could ever replicate. While competitors battle for presence in AI summaries or listicle roundups – vying to be labeled &ldquo;Best Construction Toy&rdquo; – LEGO has built differentiation through something much harder to copy: a living, breathing community that fuels product innovation, search visibility, and brand preference. No amount of AI summarization can flatten a brand&rsquo;s individuality when its users are constantly creating new stories about it. Dig deeper: How to use social and forum data to inform next-level SEO strategies From presence to preference: Why community wins The future of search can&rsquo;t be about simply being listed. Visibility alone is no longer enough. Brands need to feel alive – human – and that happens through community. AI can summarize anything, but it can&rsquo;t replicate belonging. That&rsquo;s why the brands investing in their communities today will be the ones that win tomorrow. They won&rsquo;t just be seen; they&rsquo;ll be chosen. They&rsquo;ll become the preference. So, start by asking: where is my community already thriving? Listen, nurture, and amplify. That&rsquo;s how you turn presence into preference in a world where every brand shows up.

    "essence": "The 5-Step Process To Setting Crystal Clear PPC Goals From business models to sales bottlenecks, here’s how top media buyers align paid campaigns with what clients care about most. Menachem Ani August 25, 2025 ⋅ 12 min read Menachem Ani Founder & CEO at JXT Group Bio Follow 890 READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Many agencies and marketers believe that success in paid media is primarily down to the quality of your ads or the specificity of your landing pages. While those elements are important, they&rsquo;re meaningless unless they sit on a foundation of alignment with client needs. The cleanest account structure and flawless creatives may hit every platform benchmark, but any success will be short-lived if you&rsquo;re not clued into what&rsquo;s actually important to your clients. Higher revenues, more profit, better lead quality, shorter sales cycles – this is what typically matters to the people paying the bills. At JXT Group, we make sure that the foundation is laid before building a single campaign by gathering a clear picture of how our clients make money, who their ideal customers are, and what a proper conversion looks like. Here are the five phases we use to engineer that experience. 1. Understand The Business Model Financially, most Google Ads clients can be split into one of two business models: those that sell products at face value and those that want leads who convert at a later date, typically through an offline interaction. Verticals like ecommerce and info products sell their goods (physical or otherwise) at face value, allowing you to see revenue figures inside of Google Ads. Verticals like local services and SaaS rely on capturing interest in the form of phone calls, form fills, and chat sessions. These leads may or may not turn into actual sales later. Anyone dealing with physical products also has to factor cash flow, procurement costs, shipping fees, and return rates into both how much they can spend as well as how much return they need on their ad spend. This means that the same 4x return on ad spend (ROAS) can be great for one brand with low expenses, but put another underwater. It&rsquo;s why you cannot use platform metrics like ROAS while ignoring what actually results in net profit after fulfillment. And leads need to be both high in quality and catered to promptly; otherwise, brands run the risk of low final conversion rates. As marketers, we want to drive the right type of leads at a cost that matches a client&rsquo;s close rates and order values, resulting in longer feedback loops and tighter customer relationship management (CRM) integration so we can optimize to actual revenue. 2. Match Goals To Client Priorities Simply put, not every client is chasing the same outcome. Some want to scale aggressively and are comfortable with a higher cost-per-acquisition (CPA), while others are laser-focused on efficiency and won&rsquo;t move unless the numbers are dialed in. I&rsquo;ve worked with brands whose main goal was a clean presence, ensuring their ads show only on high-quality placements and live up to their internal values. There are other niche goals, like outbidding a certain competitor or positioning themselves with a certain audience. All of these are valid, but they require different approaches. Obviously, you can&rsquo;t do anything until you figure out what matters most to the client. It might sound obvious, but too many agencies make assumptions based on platform key performance indicators (KPIs). Just because Google says a campaign is performing &ldquo;well&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s aligned with your client&rsquo;s goals. We start by asking the right questions, such as: What would success look like six to 12 months from now? Is your first priority profitability, growth, market share, or brand presence? Would you rather trade volume for efficiency or efficiency for volume? Once that&rsquo;s established, we structure everything else around it: How much budget is required. Which campaign types to run and how to structure them. What bid strategies we use. How broad or narrow our targeting needs to be. Messaging on ads and landing pages. Negative keyword lists. Targets for impression share, ROAS/CPA, and other KPIs. Without these first foundational layers, everything else you do is just guesswork. 3. Set Comprehensive And Specific Goals Once we understand the client&rsquo;s business model and goals, it&rsquo;s time to layer in our expertise. This part involves setting realistic goals that balance client desires with what we know is possible. We&rsquo;ll typically call on our vertical knowledge, experiences with past clients, and our understanding of unit economics and fulfillment to paint a complete picture. There&rsquo;s no room for mistakes like setting an arbitrary ROAS goal without asking what that revenue actually does for the business. After all, a 3x ROAS doesn&rsquo;t mean much if the margins are thin or there are hidden costs later on. With lead generation , the conversion doesn&rsquo;t end with our intake form. In fact, it&rsquo;s only the first step. The real value happens offline, when the lead turns into a paying customer, and Google has no visibility. That gap is where the greatest insights and opportunities lie, and it&rsquo;s vital that we account for it. Here&rsquo;s how to goal-set so that media performance ties back to real-world business needs. Ecommerce 1. Look at the numbers behind the numbers. This means breaking down the client&rsquo;s cost structure. What&rsquo;s the cost of goods sold? How much does shipping cost per order? Are there fulfillment fees, returns, or seasonal procurement issues? How many other vendors get paid whose fees need to be accounted for in the ROAS target? These offline costs directly impact ad sustainability. 2. Understand margins at the SKU or category level. Not every product has the same margin, so some items can scale at a lower ROAS while others need to stay profitable at first touch. We try to segment products by margin so we can set different targets where it makes sense. 3. Factor in blended performance. A customer might enter the funnel through Google Ads but convert through another channel, like email. We&rsquo;ll study how Google fits into the entire ecosystem rather than trust a narrow window of last-click attribution, so that we can temper expectations based on how it all fits together. 4. Set realistic ROAS targets. Once we understand the financials, it&rsquo;s time to work backwards. What&rsquo;s the minimum ROAS needed to break even? What target ROAS will let the brand hit profitability goals? This becomes our baseline and gives us a platform from which to build situational variance for things like seasonal demand, new product launches, and what competitors are doing. 5. Clarify the business objective behind the spend. Not all brands spend on ads for the same reason. Some want to acquire new customers, others want to clear out inventory, and others still are launching a new product or range. Each of these goals needs its own approach to bidding, creative, and measurement. Lead Generation 1. Map the full conversion journey. What happens after a lead submits a form or makes a call? Who follows up, how quickly, and what&rsquo;s the typical close rate? There is a full post-click sales flow that exists after someone registers their interest. If we don&rsquo;t understand it, we&rsquo;re optimizing in the dark. 2. Quantify the value of a lead. Different leads have different values, and Google is not privy to any of this unless you share that data back as offline conversions. For lead gen clients, we look at historical data on how many leads turn into sales and how quickly, what the average deal size is, and what the margin looks like. Then, we set up integrations between Google Ads and their CRM to feed this data back and optimize against it. 3. Use the funnel to set a target CPA. Once we know things like typical deal value and close rate, we can reverse engineer our way to a CPA that leaves enough margin on the plate. For example, needing 30 leads to close one deal worth $1,000 gives us very limited margins and runs the risk of blowing through the market. A client that closes 1 in 10 leads with a $5,000 average sale gives us a much higher ceiling on what they can pay per lead while staying profitable. 4. Control anything we can post-click. Lead gen gives us a greater opportunity to influence conversions after they click. This means landing page user experience and messaging, form length and format, automated email follow-ups, and CRM workflows. Small changes here can have an outsized impact on close rates and lead quality. 4. Employ Active Listening During Conversations Meeting with a new client is a bit like hanging out with someone new for the first time. They might not be willing to dive deep or share as openly as we&rsquo;d like, but it&rsquo;s our job to make them feel comfortable enough to do so. Surface-level answers will only take us so far. To set a truly solid strategy, we want to listen to what&rsquo;s in the spaces between their words. What are they really trying to solve? Are they really after more profit or market share, or do they just want cleaner reporting now that they have investors to answer to? A client might say they want &ldquo;more leads&rdquo; when what they really need are better leads that their sales team can actually close, but you&rsquo;ll never see that light if you take everything they say at face value. Active listening shows up in the details: Picking up on how the client talks about their sales process, not just the form submission. Hearing concerns about inventory issues before pushing hard on a best-seller. Noticing when a CEO cares more about market visibility than ROAS. It&rsquo;s a skill that takes time to develop, but it&rsquo;s also the only way to avoid misalignment and really build trust. Get this right, and your client will feel like you&rsquo;re there to make them look great and are willing to run through brick walls for them. 5. Ask Probing, Leading Questions To Reveal The Full Picture Potential clients who put up walls need you to cut through the noise. These questions will help you get to the real motivation behind their desire to spend on paid search, as well as allow you to spot red flags that might indicate a difficult client. Business Direction What would success look like to you in the next six to 12 months? This helps them move beyond &ldquo;more leads&rdquo; or &ldquo;better ROAS&rdquo; and focus on outcomes. If Google Ads disappeared tomorrow, what would break in your business? This reveals how critical paid media is to their revenue engine. Is this about profitability, growth, or positioning? Few clients won&rsquo;t say &ldquo;all three,&rdquo; but keep pressing, and they&rsquo;ll tell you what they&rsquo;d sacrifice first. Are you looking to maintain, grow, or exit? You should know if they&rsquo;re scaling to sell, which changes everything about risk tolerance and KPIs. Finance & Economics What&rsquo;s your average profit margin after all costs, e.g., ads, fulfillment, labor? If they don&rsquo;t have this information ready and can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t source it, that should be a red flag about their openness. What do you pay to acquire a customer? What&rsquo;s the most you can afford to pay? See if they&rsquo;re thinking in terms of lifetime value or just looking at front-end performance. Do we need to factor in any fixed costs that most media buyers wouldn&rsquo;t know about? It opens the door to discussions about warehousing, returns, sales commissions, etc. Lead Quality & Sales Process What do you consider to be a &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; lead? This forces them to define quality, which is far superior to treating all leads the same or leaving the definition vague. What happens after a lead comes through? You want to know how long it usually takes to close a deal and what their team does to facilitate that. The answer will show you how strong or weak their internal follow-up process is. How often do you listen to sales calls or review what&rsquo;s happening post-click? If the answer is never, it tells you the magnitude of the support they&rsquo;ll need to improve close rates. This might not be something you can control. Bottlenecks & Internal Dynamics Who has the final say on marketing and business decisions? You&rsquo;ll avoid many headaches and painful back-and-forth by establishing this upfront. What have you tried in the past that didn&rsquo;t work, and why not? Ask this to get insight into previous agency relationships, internal friction, or unrealistic expectations. If we start today and in six months you&rsquo;re unhappy, what will have gone wrong? This one is gold as it can expose fears, past traumas, and give you a roadmap on how to hit alignment. But, even if you get all these answers and follow all the advice in this article, communication with your clients is the key to establishing a relationship where you&rsquo;re trusted and given space to operate. Without proactive and consistent two-way communication, their perceptions may not align with what you&rsquo;re doing. Remember: You&rsquo;re The Expert, But You&rsquo;re Not In Charge One thing many agencies and marketers tend to forget as they manage thousands and millions of dollars in ad spend is that we build on leased land. These are not our accounts and campaigns, and we don&rsquo;t pay the advertising bills. So, even though it&rsquo;s important for clients to defer to our expertise, ultimately, they&rsquo;re the ones who call the shots when it comes to direction and strategy. The other angle to this is that it&rsquo;s not our job to make ourselves look good or even to get a solid case study out of an engagement; those are bonuses. Our job is to service client needs, maximize results within the spend allocated to us, and make our clients look phenomenal in front of the people they answer to.

Question I’m currently on my second product launch, and my first attempt at marketing didn’t go the way I hoped. It wasn’t a total failure, but it taught me some lessons I’m applying this time around. From my first launch, I learned that running ads before validating the product is a mistake. It’s tempting to think ads will solve traction, but without product-market fit, they just burn cash. The second lesson was that relying only on word-of-mouth isn’t enough. Early users talked, but growth stalled fast. Now, I’m balancing organic channels with small, targeted experiments instead of going all-in on one approach. I’d love to hear from others , what’s been your biggest marketing mistake, and how do you approach marketing effectively without overspending or overcomplicating? Read more Share",

    "essence": "How To Leverage AI To Modernize B2B Go-To-Market Reimagine your B2B go-to-market strategy by harnessing AI not just for efficiency, but to unlock transformative, revenue-driving capabilities. VIP CONTRIBUTOR Alexander Kesler August 25, 2025 ⋅ 11 min read VIP CONTRIBUTOR Alexander Kesler Founder & CEO at INFUSE Bio Follow 1.1K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> In a post &ldquo;growth-at-all-costs&rdquo; era, B2B go-to-market (GTM) teams face a dual mandate: operate with greater efficiency while driving measurable business outcomes . Many organizations see AI as the definitive means of achieving this efficiency. The reality is that AI is no longer a speculative investment. It has emerged as a strategic enabler to unify data, align siloed teams, and adapt to complex buyer behaviors in real time. According to an SAP study, 48% of executives use generative AI tools daily, while 15% use AI multiple times per day. The opportunity for modern Go-to-Market (GTM) leaders is not just to accelerate legacy tactics with AI, but to reimagine the architecture of their GTM strategy altogether. This shift represents an inflection point. AI has the potential to power seamless and adaptive GTM systems: measurable, scalable, and deeply aligned with buyer needs. In this article, I will share a practical framework to modernize B2B GTM using AI, from aligning internal teams and architecting modular workflows to measuring what truly drives revenue. The Role Of AI In Modern GTM Strategies For GTM leaders and practitioners, AI represents an opportunity to achieve efficiency without compromising performance. Many organizations leverage new technology to automate repetitive, time-intensive tasks, such as prospect scoring and routing, sales forecasting, content personalization, and account prioritization. But its true impact lies in transforming how GTM systems operate: consolidating data, coordinating actions, extracting insights, and enabling intelligent engagement across every stage of the buyer&rsquo;s journey. Where previous technologies offered automation, AI introduces sophisticated real-time orchestration. Rather than layering AI onto existing workflows, AI can be used to enable previously unscalable capabilities such as: Surfacing and aligning intent signals from disconnected platforms. Predicting buyer stage and engagement timing. Providing full pipeline visibility across sales, marketing, client success, and operations. Standardizing inputs across teams and systems. Enabling cross-functional collaboration in real time. Forecasting potential revenue from campaigns. With AI-powered data orchestration, GTM teams can align on what matters, act faster, and deliver more revenue with fewer resources. AI is not merely an efficiency lever. It is a path to capabilities that were previously out of reach. Framework: Building An AI-Native GTM Engine Creating a modern GTM engine powered by AI demands a re-architecture of how teams align, how data is managed, and how decisions are executed at every level. Below is a five-part framework that explains how to centralize data, build modular workflows, and train your model: 1. Develop Centralized, Clean Data AI performance is only as strong as the data it receives. Yet, in many organizations, data lives in disconnected silos. Centralizing structured, validated, and accessible data across all departments at your organization is foundational. AI needs clean, labeled, and timely inputs to make precise micro-decisions. These decisions, when chained together, power reliable macro-actions such as intelligent routing, content sequencing, and revenue forecasting. In short, better data enables smarter orchestration and more consistent outcomes. Luckily, AI can be used to break down these silos across marketing, sales, client success, and operations by leveraging a customer data platform (CDP), which integrates data from your customer relationship management (CRM), marketing automation (MAP), and customer success (CS) platforms. The steps are as follows: Appoint a data steward who owns data hygiene and access policies. Select a CDP that pulls records from your CRM, MAP, and other tools with client data. Configure deduplication and enrichment routines, and tag fields consistently. Establish a shared, organization-wide dashboard so every team works from the same definitions. Recommended starting point: Schedule a workshop with operations, analytics, and IT to map current data sources and choose one system of record for account identifiers. 2. Build An AI-Native Operating Model Instead of layering AI onto legacy systems, organizations will be better suited to architect their GTM strategies from the ground up to be AI-native. This requires designing adaptive workflows that rely on machine input and positioning AI as the operating core, not just a support layer. AI can deliver the most value when it unifies previously fragmented processes. Rather than simply accelerating isolated tasks like prospect scoring or email generation, AI should orchestrate entire GTM motions, seamlessly adapting messaging, channels, and timing based on buyer intent and journey stage. Achieving this transformation demands new roles within the GTM organization, such as AI strategists, workflow architects, and data stewards. In other words, experts focused on building and maintaining intelligent systems rather than executing manual processes. AI-enabled GTM is not about automation alone; it&rsquo;s about synchronization, intelligence, and scalability at every touchpoint. Once you have committed to building an AI-native GTM model, the next step is to implement it through modular, data-driven workflows. Recommended starting point: Assemble a cross-functional strike team and map one buyer journey end-to-end, highlighting every manual hand-off that could be streamlined by AI. 3. Break Down GTM Into Modular AI Workflows A major reason AI initiatives fail is when organizations do too much at once. This is why large, monolithic projects often stall. Success comes from deconstructing large GTM tasks into a series of focused, modular AI workflows. Each workflow should perform a specific, deterministic task, such as: Assessing prospect quality on certain clear, predefined inputs. Prioritizing outreach. Forecasting revenue contribution. If we take the first workflow, which assesses prospect quality, this would entail integrating or implementing a lead scoring AI tool with your model and then feeding in data such as website activity, engagement, and CRM data. You can then instruct your model to automatically route top-scoring prospects to sales representatives, for example. Similarly, for your forecasting workflow, connect forecasting tools to your model and train it on historical win/loss data, pipeline stages, and buyer activity logs. To sum up: Integrate only the data required. Define clear success criteria. Establish a feedback loop that compares model output with real outcomes. Once the first workflow proves reliable, replicate the pattern for additional use cases. When AI is trained on historical data with clearly defined criteria, its decisions become predictable, explainable, and scalable. Recommended starting point: Draft a simple flow diagram with seven or fewer steps, identify one automation platform to orchestrate them, and assign service-level targets for speed and accuracy. 4. Continuously Test And Train AI Models An AI-powered GTM engine is not static. It must be monitored, tested, and retrained continuously. As markets, products, and buyer behaviors shift, these changing realities affect the accuracy and efficiency of your model. Plus, according to OpenAI itself, one of the latest iterations of its large language model (LLM) can hallucinate up to 48% of the time, emphasizing the importance of embedding rigorous validation processes, first-party data inputs, and ongoing human oversight to safeguard decision-making and maintain trust in predictive outputs. Maintaining AI model efficiency requires three steps: Set clear validation checkpoints and build feedback loops that surface errors or inefficiencies. Establish thresholds for when AI should hand off to human teams and ensure that every automated decision is verified. Ongoing iteration is key to performance and trust. Set a regular cadence for evaluation. At a minimum, conduct performance audits monthly and retrain models quarterly based on new data or shifting GTM priorities. During these maintenance cycles, use the following criteria to test the AI model: Ensure accuracy: Regularly validate AI outputs against real-world outcomes to confirm predictions are reliable. Maintain relevance: Continuously update models with fresh data to reflect changes in buyer behavior, market trends, and messaging strategies Optimize for efficiency: Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) like time-to-action, conversion rates, and resource utilization to ensure AI is driving measurable gains. Prioritize explainability: Choose models and workflows that offer transparent decision logic so GTM teams can interpret results, trust outputs, and make manual adjustments as needed. By combining cadence, accountability, and testing rigor, you create an AI engine for GTM that not only scales but improves continuously. Recommended starting point: Put a recurring calendar invite on the books titled &ldquo;AI Model Health Review&rdquo; and attach an agenda covering validation metrics and required updates. 5. Focus On Outcomes, Not Features Success is not defined by AI adoption, but by outcomes. Benchmark AI performance against real business metrics such as: Pipeline velocity. Conversion rates . Client acquisition cost (CAC). Marketing-influenced revenue. Focus on use cases that unlock new insights, streamline decision-making, or drive action that was previously impossible. When a workflow stops improving its target metric, refine or retire it. Recommended starting point: Demonstrate value to stakeholders in the AI model by exhibiting its impact on pipeline opportunity or revenue generation. Common Pitfalls To Avoid 1. Over-Reliance On Vanity Metrics Too often, GTM teams focus AI efforts on optimizing for surface-level KPIs, like marketing qualified lead (MQL) volume or click-through rates, without tying them to revenue outcomes. AI that increases prospect quantity without improving prospect quality only accelerates inefficiency. The true test of value is pipeline contribution: Is AI helping to identify, engage, and convert buying groups that close and drive revenue? If not, it is time to rethink how you measure its efficiency. 2. Treating AI As A Tool, Not A Transformation Many teams introduce AI as a plug-in to existing workflows rather than as a catalyst for reinventing them. This results in fragmented implementations that underdeliver and confuse stakeholders. AI is not just another tool in the tech stack or a silver bullet. It is a strategic enabler that requires changes in roles, processes, and even how success is defined. Organizations that treat AI as a transformation initiative will gain exponential advantages over those who treat it as a checkbox. A recommended approach for testing workflows is to build a lightweight AI system with APIs to connect fragmented systems without needing complicated development. 3. Ignoring Internal Alignment AI cannot solve misalignment; it amplifies it. When sales, marketing, and operations are not working from the same data, definitions, or goals, AI will surface inconsistencies rather than fix them. A successful AI-driven GTM engine depends on tight internal alignment. This includes unified data sources, shared KPIs, and collaborative workflows. Without this foundation, AI can easily become another point of friction rather than a force multiplier. A Framework For The C-Level AI is redefining what high-performance GTM leadership looks like. For C-level executives, the mandate is clear: Lead with a vision that embraces transformation, executes with precision, and measures what drives value. Below is a framework grounded in the core pillars modern GTM leaders must uphold: Vision: Shift From Transactional Tactics To Value-Centric Growth The future of GTM belongs to those who see beyond prospect quotas and focus on building lasting value across the entire buyer journey. When narratives resonate with how decisions are really made (complex, collaborative, and cautious), they unlock deeper engagement. GTM teams thrive when positioned as strategic allies. The power of AI lies not in volume, but in relevance: enhancing personalization, strengthening trust, and earning buyer attention. This is a moment to lean into meaningful progress, not just for pipeline, but for the people behind every buying decision. Execution: Invest In Buyer Intelligence, Not Just Outreach Volume AI makes it easier than ever to scale outreach, but quantity alone no longer wins. Today&rsquo;s B2B buyers are defensive, independent, and value-driven. Leadership teams that prioritize technology and strategic market imperative will enable their organizations to better understand buying signals, account context, and journey stage. This intelligence-driven execution ensures resources are spent on the right accounts, at the right time, with the right message. Measurement: Focus On Impact Metrics Surface-level metrics no longer tell the full story. Modern GTM demands a deeper, outcome-based lens – one that tracks what truly moves the business, such as pipeline velocity, deal conversion, CAC efficiency, and the impact of marketing across the entire revenue journey. But the real promise of AI is meaningful connection. When early intent signals are tied to late-stage outcomes, GTM leaders gain the clarity to steer strategy with precision. Executive dashboards should reflect the full funnel because that is where real growth and real accountability live. Enablement: Equip Teams With Tools, Training, And Clarity Transformation does not succeed without people. Leaders must ensure their teams are not only equipped with AI-powered tools but also trained to use them effectively. Equally important is clarity around strategy, data definitions, and success criteria. AI will not replace talent, but it will dramatically increase the gap between enabled teams and everyone else. Key Takeaways Redefine success metrics: Move beyond vanity KPIs like MQLs and focus on impact metrics: pipeline velocity, deal conversion, and CAC efficiency. Build AI-native workflows: Treat AI as a foundational layer in your GTM architecture, not a bolt-on feature to existing processes. Align around the buyer: Use AI to unify siloed data and teams , delivering synchronized, context-rich engagement throughout the buyer journey. Lead with purposeful change: C-level executives must shift from transactional growth to value-led transformation by investing in buyer intelligence, team enablement, and outcome-driven execution.

We’ve already produced video tutorials. Questions: Are live webinars still working for SaaS growth in 2025 (user acquisition, not just retention)?

My experience has been in art direction, motion design, and campaign development, but I’ve increasingly partnered with product marketing, demand gen, and growth teams to drive pipeline and measurable results. I’m now looking to pivot out of hands-on creative execution and into growth marketing and strategy. For those of you who have made a similar move (or worked with people who did): What skills should I double down on to make myself marketable in growth? Where do senior creatives typically struggle when moving into growth marketing roles? Are there specific roles/titles I should target first to bridge the gap?

    "essence": "Tips For Running Competitor Campaigns In Paid Search A practical guide to deciding if competitor keyword bidding makes sense for your brand and how to approach it without burning your budget. VIP CONTRIBUTOR Tim Jensen August 22, 2025 ⋅ 7 min read VIP CONTRIBUTOR Tim Jensen Sr. Search Engine Marketing Specialist at M&T Bank Bio Follow 1.1K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Paid search professionals constantly debate the merits of running paid search campaigns bidding on competitor brand names. Questions such as the following may arise: Is bidding on your competitors ethical? Are the high costs-per-click (CPCs) worth spending the budget on? Are you actually reaching people with buying intent? In this article, I&rsquo;ll talk through answers to these questions and more to help you understand if a competitor search campaign might be right for your brand. Table of Contents 1. Competitor Bidding Ethics 2. Cost-Benefit Analysis Of Competitor Bidding 3. Determining Competitors To Bid On 4. Create Your Ads 5. What Happens After The Ad? 6. Launch And Monitor Results Competitor Bidding Ethics Google and Microsoft allow you to bid on your competitor&rsquo;s name within keywords (and this right has even been tested in the courts here and here .), but you cannot directly mention a trademarked brand name (that you don&rsquo;t have the rights to use) in ad copy. In addition, even if you don&rsquo;t include their name, you should not write your ad copy in a way that a user thinks they may be going to your competitor&rsquo;s site instead of yours. For instance, you might use the headline &ldquo;Official Site&rdquo; (without mentioning whose official site you&rsquo;re pointing to). When a user sees that in conjunction with having searched for the competitor&rsquo;s name, they may naturally think they&rsquo;re going to that company&rsquo;s site. Finally, the landing page should also clearly feature your brand&rsquo;s name and logo in order to avoid deception . Cost-Benefit Analysis Of Competitor Bidding Let&rsquo;s face it: competitor keywords can have expensive CPCs. High competition around these keywords in many industries drives up cost. You&rsquo;ll also generally struggle to achieve a decent quality score due to other companies&rsquo; brand keywords naturally being deemed less relevant to your ads and landing pages, which can also impact cost. Because of the high potential cost, competitor bidding does not make sense for all industries or brands. For instance, if you&rsquo;re selling products with a low profit margin, bidding on these pricy keywords may not work. Generally, this tactic works best for higher cost, higher margin products and services, as it&rsquo;s easier to still yield a return on investment (ROI) after higher costs-per-acquisition (CPAs) and lower conversion rates . Be careful also about entering competitor bidding &ldquo;wars&rdquo; for the sole reason that other brands are bidding on your name. This action can quickly lead to rising CPCs for all with little payoff. One scenario where I&rsquo;ve seen competitor bidding work best is when a company offers a very specific, complex service that&rsquo;s difficult to sum up in a search query but has established brands that the right prospects would be familiar with. For instance, if you&rsquo;re promoting software for a particular type of industrial machine, niche buyers may be aware of companies that already provide that software. Once you&rsquo;ve established a use case for competitor bidding, you should establish a list of brands to use. Determining Competitors To Bid On When figuring out which competitor brands to bid on, you should rely on a combination of both internal company data as well as ad platform data. First of all, talk with key stakeholders in marketing and sales to determine who the brand considers to be top competitors. Who has similar products and services? Which brands target similar prospects (whether by location, demographic, or company traits)? Note that this list may not and likely will not contain all potential competitors. If you have established paid search campaigns already, use auction insights to see the top brands showing up for the same queries as yours. Of course, these may not all be completely relevant and will require some vetting through. Once you&rsquo;ve compiled a list, it&rsquo;s time to think through the keywords you&rsquo;ll bid on. Who Is (And Isn&rsquo;t) Your Audience Be careful about going unnecessarily broad in the keywords you&rsquo;re using in competitor campaigns. Generally, if you&rsquo;re just bidding on the brand name alone, you&rsquo;re likely reaching a lot of existing customers looking to log in, place online orders, or find a nearby location without giving a second thought to anything else. For instance, Apple isn&rsquo;t going to sell many MacBooks by bidding on the word &ldquo;Microsoft.&rdquo; Ideally, you want to reach people who are in a research phase, indicated by wording in their search query: [Brand name] + cost/pricing [Brand name] + compare/vs [Brand name] + reviews [Brand name] + pros/cons [Brand name] + alternatives [Brand name] + features While a potentially riskier strategy, as people may be in a heated moment, you could also test targeting people experiencing issues and potentially in the market to switch: [Brand name] + support [Brand name] + troubleshoot [Brand name] + cancel Create Your Ads Now, think through the ad copy you&rsquo;ll put in front of prospects searching for competitors. Take some time to review competitor ads and offers, considering how your calls-to-action (CTAs) will stack up. Think through areas where you &ldquo;win&rdquo; against certain competitors and highlight those. Remember that these may vary based on the brand you&rsquo;re bidding against. For instance, you may have lower costs than a certain competitor and highlight pricing for those searches, while you may have higher costs than another competitor but have unique features to highlight. Also, look at how your offers compare. If one competitor offers a seven-day demo and you offer a 30-day demo, feature that in your ad. This also should be an area you regularly monitor and adjust CTAs based on how competitors tweak their ads and offers. What Happens After The Ad? One maxim applicable to any paid search campaign is that what happens on the search engine results page up to the ad click is only one portion of the user experience. A significant portion of the decision process happens after reaching the landing page, beyond what you can control in keywords and ad copy. Think through what your prospect is seeing based on the context that they were researching a competitor. Your homepage probably isn&rsquo;t the best place to land them, and the same sales landing page you use for more general keywords may not be ideal either. Assuming a user is comparison shopping, placing some content on your landing page positioning your brand against others will likely help. For instance, you could create a table showing how your features and pricing stack up vs. competitors (either mentioning specific names or providing industry averages). You could also hone in on trust signals that set your brand apart. Highlight industry awards you&rsquo;ve won. Mention the number of accounts serviced. Talk about how many integrations you have with commonly used products. If you need to establish a baseline for comparing against other companies, prompt a large language model (LLM) to put together a list of features for your brand and a list of top competitors. Provide the URLs for pages that would contain products/services to flesh this out. Launch And Monitor Results Once you have your competitor campaigns fleshed out, it&rsquo;s time to get them off the ground and see what performance looks like. In addition to ensuring proper conversion tracking and watching for lead/sale quality, you&rsquo;ll also want to keep an eye out for both how current competitors change up their offers and new competitors entering the space that may be worth targeting. With a carefully thought-out setup and proper monitoring, you may find that competitor search campaigns allow you to capture leads or sales from queries you were not previously reaching. On the other hand, you may discover that for your industry, the CPAs and conversion rates aren&rsquo;t worthwhile, but as with anything in PPC, you ran a test and learned the results. At the very least, take stock of potential competitors in your field and consider testing if you are looking to expand your reach in paid search.

I just saw one on Facebook — it was a brand I've never heard of promoting a product I’d never buy. I'm not the brand’s target audience, and that brand is missing out by not understanding who to market their product towards. No company can market to everyone — so who are you selling to? That's the question that your target audience answers. Good targeting speaks directly to a specific group, making viewers feel connected with the brand. Understanding target audiences is key to any successful marketing strategy. Every product and service has a target audience, no matter how niche. In this article, I'll walk you through how to perform a target audience analysis for your brand. Table of Contents What is a target audience? Target Market vs Target Audience Types of Target Audiences How to Find Your Target Audience Target Audience Examples What is a target audience? “Target audience” refers to a group of consumers characterized by shared qualities like demographic data, behaviors, interests, etc. Most companies and products will have multiple target audiences representing diverse products and user groups. Brands identify their target consumers by articulating audience features to create a clear picture of who the potential customer is. This image clarifies brand messaging, focuses marketing efforts, and even guides what products to develop next. For example, a wine company can't sell to both high-end wine aficionados and novice wine drinkers. Through target audience research, they could identify their target wine drinkers as those ages 24 to 30 who have an interest in wine but limited budgets. Knowing their audience, they can focus on appealing to those buyers instead of trying to appeal to everyone. Is it the same as a buyer persona ? No — your target audience represents your entire potential consumer group. Your buyer persona is a fictional representation of one target audience member.

Download Now Target Market vs Target Audience Both target market and target audience are ways of grouping customers for segmentation. However, “target market” refers to the broader group of potential customers. The target audience sits within the target market and is a more specific segment. Let's use an example of the IKEA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Target market : People in western Pennsylvania. Target audience : People in western Pennsylvania who want to buy budget-friendly furniture. One potential target segment : Expectant parents in western Pennsylvania who need budget-friendly nursery furniture. After identifying a target segment, you then create buyer personas that represent the detailed emotions and needs of each customer segment. Are the terms making more sense? Don ' t worry, this isn’t a test and you won't fail — as long as you focus on understanding the people who buy your product. Types of Target Audiences The world doesn't need more generic marketing campaigns. Personalization is key, and it’s something that modern consumers expect. A Boston Consulting Group (BCG) survey found that more than 80% of respondents reported wanting and expecting personalized experiences. This is achieved by focusing on your brand's different target audience types. Here they are at a glance: Demographics : Who your customer is Customer journey stage : How well they know your brand Interests : How customers spend their time Subcultures : Relevant customer identities Values : What matters most to your buyers Let's look at what makes these special, plus pull real-life examples to learn from. Demographics Demographic segmentation divides a market into smaller categories based on variable characteristics such as age, race, gender, marital status, income, education, and nationality. Each demographic factor influences consumer behavior and product preferences. For example: Gender : Consumers often make fashion, beauty, and health purchases that align with their gender identity. Marketing strategies often differ when targeting men, women, or non-binary shoppers. Income : Economic status influences buying power, impacting what products or services consumers can afford. Age : Product preferences can vary significantly between different age groups, as do advertising media and ad campaigns. For example, AARP's business strategy is built on age segmentation: the brand targets individuals who are at retirement age or pre-retirement age. This is clearly reflected in marketing materials like this Facebook post about “elderspeak.” Demographic data is acquired through censuses, market surveys, and analytical tools. Customer Journey Stages The term “customer journey” refers to the different touchpoints that a customer has with a brand. Common stages include product awareness, consideration, purchase, and retention. When targeting different points of the customer journey, your marketing should address questions like: Awareness : What is this product? Consideration : Why should I buy? Purchase : Is this product right for me? Retention : Why should I buy again? This type of targeting is effective because it delivers the exact messaging people need, given their familiarity with the product. Let's look at electrolyte company Liquid IV as an example and see how they create content targeting the different stages of the customer journey: What is Liquid IV? Awareness content educates prospective buyers on the product pain points and introduces the product as a solution. Why should someone buy it? Consideration content helps users understand product benefits. What's the best product for me right now? Purchase content shares product details and social proof. Why should I buy it again? Retention content encourages repeat purchases by sharing additional product uses. Source Interests Interests represent the hobbies and activities that customers enjoy. Understanding customer interests helps you unearth buyer motivation and behaviors and connect with your audience in a relatable way. One product can have different target groups based on customer interests. Let's use a bicycle as an example. Cyclist A might be interested in racing bikes. This customer wants to burn calories after work by cycling long distances. Cyclist B could enjoy a relaxing bike commute to work. Understanding customer interests as they pertain to your product is crucial in reaching the right buyers. Priority Bicycles caters to the interests of Cyclist B. That's clear through the company slogan: “bicycles for everyday riders.” This clear stance makes it very easy for cyclists to self-select if this company is right for their interests. Source Subcultures Subcultures represent interests, lifestyles, or identities that some of your customers share. They're similar to customer interests, but a subculture is directly tied to identity. People define themselves by their subcultures, and each group has distinctive interests and needs. For example, not all parents are the same. Parents of adult children belong to a different subculture from parents of toddlers. Understanding the subcultures within your target market helps sharpen marketing materials and make groups feel represented. A real-life example of subculture targeting is Liquid Death, a canned water company. The company has been rooted in the music subculture from the beginning. It has maintained that connection to the music industry through social media content, company aesthetic, partnerships, and events. Source Values Consumers have unique values that impact how they live their lives and which brands they monetarily support. Customers who align with a brand's values are more likely to try a product, repeat a purchase, and recommend the product to others. Some values include: Sustainability Transparency Social justice Accessibility Affordability Community Inclusion Diversity These values are more than just talking points: they're deep insights into how consumers see themselves and who they aspire to be. Examining customer values can also help you identify industry trends. For example, an interest in plastic-free product packaging is a manifestation of the public's growing awareness about ocean pollution and landfill contribution. Nuud deodorant knows that its customers care about the environment and the chemicals they use on their bodies. The product aligns with customers' values by being plastic-free, natural, vegan, and cruelty-free. @nuudcare ♬ original sound - nuud | fresh armpits worldwide Tip: This classification is less straightforward than demographics because it deals with subjective internal characteristics that can be harder to measure. Consider trying a customer survey or using social listening tools to gather data on what values align with your product.

Download Now How to Find Your Target Audience Here are five steps you can take to define and refine your target audience. 1. Use HubSpot Analytics to learn more about your customers. According to HubSpot's 2024 State of Marketing report, only 65% of marketers have high-quality data about their target audience . This leaves 35% who don't know their audience definitively. HubSpot Analytics is an excellent tool for gathering demographic details about your audience, as well as real-time analytics about your marketing campaign's performance. Here's some information you can find in the analytics dashboard. Traffic Analytics This tracks your website's performance and other digital assets. It provides metrics like page views, unique visitors, bounce rates, and session duration. You can also see your traffic sources (organic, direct, referrals, social media, etc.), which helps you understand which channels are driving the most engagement. Conversion Analytics HubSpot allows you to track how well your landing pages and other conversion tools are performing. This includes data on form submissions, lead conversions, and the effectiveness of different calls-to-action (CTAs). You can also analyze the conversion paths to optimize the steps your visitors take from entering the site to becoming leads to becoming paid customers. Campaign Analytics Easily measure the performance of each marketing campaign you're running inside of HubSpot. This includes impressions, clicks, conversions, sales, and ROI. This helps you gauge which campaigns are the most effective. Custom Reports HubSpot allows you to create custom reports that fit specific needs. You can pull together various data points from across marketing, sales, and service platforms to create comprehensive reports to meet your unique business requirements. Pro tip: If you're not using HubSpot analytics, you can connect your website to Google Analytics to find demographic data about your target audience, including their age, gender, interests, lifestyle, nationality, and more. 2. Use website data to gauge audience interests. Which website pages are getting the most views, shares, and comments? Both the thriving and floundering pages contain valuable behavioral insights for you to learn from. Start by learning from the top performers. Are there themes between the most popular pages? How are users finding them? How long do users spend on the page, and how far down do they scroll? After reading, do they click around or become an email subscriber? Pro tip: Implement a streamlined navigation menu or sidebar that prominently features your popular content so visitors can easily find these thriving pages. Some businesses highlight their top-performing content on their website in a “trending” or “most popular” section, like Glossier's blog: Source Then, analyze underperforming content. Are there themes between which pages get the least traffic? Are they visible on the website, or are they buried? Are they optimized for search? Is it possible that the pages with low readership are aligned with your audience, but the pages aren't being discovered? I ' ve found that many businesses have quality content buried deep in their blog archives. If you find old pieces aren’t being read but are still valuable, update them for improved search visibility. 3. Analyze social media data for additional insights. Social media channels collect different data from your website that can include robust insights into customer demographics and content preferences. Analyze two types of social media data: Demographic data: Where do customers live? How old are they? Content preferences: What do viewers engage most with? What attracts the most new viewers? What ' s working and what’s not? Every social channel is different and has a diverse audience, so it's essential to look at your analytics across all social platforms . Here's an example of some of the insights you can get from Facebook Analytics: Pro tip: Some platforms, like Facebook, allow you to use detailed demographic information to segment your audience and customize your marketing campaigns. You can effectively tailor your content, messaging, and advertising strategies to match the characteristics and preferences of different audience segments.

Social media is a readily available, free place to conduct market research. Engage with your audience through surveys, interactive polls, and “ask us anything” questionnaires. Use this invaluable two-way medium to ask questions like: How are they using your product? What's their biggest complaint related to the problem you solve? How often do they use your product? This can be done directly on social media platforms — Instagram Stories is probably the most popular place. Alternatively, you can create a formal survey and ask social media followers to participate. Remember: all engagement is valuable, whether it's positive or negative. Pro tip: You can maximize engagement by showcasing the results of your questionnaires. This signals to your audience that their input is valued, which enhances loyalty and attracts new followers. Here's a great survey example from budget bus company FlixBus: Source FlixBus' social media content aligned perfectly with its audience: budget travelers who love a good deal. As a customer, I feel seen by their humor and surveys. 5. Articulate your inverted audience. Sometimes the details of a well-defined target audience emerge most clearly when describing who you aren't targeting. What consumers would be a bad fit for your brand? Who are you trying to repel? This is also known as a negative persona . Let's look at two contrasting water brands as an example. First up is Boxed Water, which targets consumers who are interested in the environment, wellness, and simplicity. Source Let’s compare Boxed Water to Evian Water. Evian might describe its customers as people who value sports, luxury food, and premium events. Seeing the Instagram feeds side-by-side helps sharpen the qualities that make these brands unique. Source Remember this inverted thinking exercise as we look at examples below. I pulled five real-life target audience examples and included contrasting brands for each one to help make the audience crystal clear.

Download Now Target Audience Examples Let ' s take the concepts we’ve reviewed above and see how they manifest in the examples below. 1. Aldi Aldi is a budget supermarket chain that appeals to practical shoppers who prioritize savings over style. The company ' s approach to audience targeting works because of its focus on the average consumer’s everyday needs. The majority of the store is stocked with staples instead of endless SKUs and brand names. One section of the store (nicknamed the “Aldi finds” section) is stocked with random rotating items that range from underwear to seasonal cookies to dorm room decor. Source Aldi ' s marketing doesn’t make buyers aspire to put together a perfect Instagram-worthy dinner or transform their health. Instead, they lean into budget cooking and life's everyday chaos. Their marketing is relatable and laughs along with viewers, like this post on Threads: Source Who isn't Aldi trying to target? Aesthetic shoppers (like Trader Joe's) or health-first consumers (like Whole Foods). What I like: When Aldi first became popular where I live, it was known as the store with the weird layout and no shopping bags. The company didn't try to blend with the competition: it built a relationship with consumers based on reliable prices and food quality. 2. Duolingo Duolingo is a language learning app that uses humor and pop-culture relevance to appeal to Gen Z and millennial consumers who want to dabble in language learning. Have a look at Duolingo's marketing channels and you may ask yourself “What does any of this have to do with language learning?” The answer: not much . Instead of sharing grammar tips, the marketing focuses on establishing the brand as a piece of pop culture. Language learning is typically rooted in a cultural interest in the language you're learning. But Duolingo understands that casual language learning is a cultural shift in itself, from formal to fun . Source Duolingo's approach to audience targeting works because of its emphasis on progress instead of fluency. Gamification is a key piece of its brand and how it differentiates itself from competitors. Here ' s an example of a viral TikTok video that aligns learning Korean on Duolingo with Netflix’s popular show Squid Game: @duolingo 🌸 KOREAN OR GET EATEN 🌸 on Spotify now - link in bio! #duolingo #netflix #squidgame #squidgame2 ♬ original sound - Duolingo Who isn't Duolingo trying to attract? Serious language learners who want to develop conversation skills (like Rosetta Stone). What I like: As a Duolingo user (currently practicing Dutch), I don't expect to gain language fluency on the app in a few minutes a day. I just enjoy the satisfaction of daily practice, no matter how small. 3. Dunkin' This company‘s understanding of its target audience is apparent even in the name. Dunkin’, previously Dunkin' Donuts, underwent a rebrand in 2018 . It pivoted away from its sugary namesake and embraced what its audience loved most: coffee to help you through the daily grind. Dunkin ' s approach to audience targeting works because they understand how their consumers use their product: Dunkin’ knows that users love grabbing a coffee on their way to work. Source They position themselves as being embedded in customers' busy routines, even with their slogan: “America runs on Dunkin'.” This philosophy oozes out of Dunkin's funny, relatable social media content: Source Who isn't Dunkin' trying to attract? Coffee drinkers who want to get comfy with a cup of specialty coffee in a stylish setting (l",

    "essence": "Google: Why Lazy Loading Can Delay Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) On Google’s podcast, Martin Splitt explains how default lazy loading can delay LCP, why some libraries hinder indexing, and how to verify fixes. Google warns against lazy-loading above-the-fold images. It can delay LCP and feel jarring for visitors. Verify in Search Console by checking the rendered HTML. SEJ STAFF Matt G. Southern August 21, 2025 ⋅ 4 min read SEJ STAFF Matt G. Southern Senior News Writer at Search Engine Journal Bio Follow 3.0K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> In a recent episode of Google&rsquo;s Search Off the Record podcast, Martin Splitt and John Mueller discussed when lazy loading helps and when it can slow pages. Splitt used a real-world example on developers.google.com to illustrate a common pattern: making every image lazy by default can delay Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) if it includes above-the-fold visuals. Splitt said: &ldquo;The content management system that we are using for developers.google.com ... defaults all images to lazy loading, which is not great.&rdquo; Splitt used the example to explain why lazy-loading hero images is risky: you tell the browser to wait on the most visible element, which can push back LCP and cause layout shifts if dimensions aren&rsquo;t set. Splitt said: &ldquo;If you are using lazy loading on an image that is immediately visible, that is most likely going to have an impact on your largest contentful paint. It&rsquo;s like almost guaranteed.&rdquo; How Lazy Loading Delays LCP LCP measures the moment the largest text or image in the initial viewport is painted. Normally, the browser&rsquo;s preload scanner finds that hero image early and fetches it with high priority so it can paint fast. When you add loading=\"lazy\" to that same hero, you change the browser&rsquo;s scheduling: The image is treated as lower priority, so other resources start first. The browser waits until layout and other work progress before it requests the hero image. The hero then competes for bandwidth after scripts, styles, and other assets have already queued. That delay shifts the paint time of the largest element later, which increases your LCP. On slow networks or CPU-limited devices, the effect is more noticeable. If width and height are missing, the late image can also nudge layout and feel &ldquo;jarring.&rdquo; SEO Risk With Some Libraries Browsers now support a built-in loading attribute for images and iframes, which removes the need for heavy JavaScript in standard scenarios. WordPress adopted native lazy loading by default, helping it spread. Splitt said: &ldquo;Browsers got a native attribute for images and iframes, the loading attribute ... which makes the browser take care of the lazy loading for you.&rdquo; Older or custom lazy-loading libraries can hide image URLs in nonstandard attributes. If the real URL never lands in src or srcset in the HTML Google renders, images may not get picked up for indexing. Splitt said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen multiple lazy loading libraries ... that use some sort of data-source attribute rather than the source attribute... If it&rsquo;s not in the source attribute, we won&rsquo;t pick it up if it&rsquo;s in some custom attribute.&rdquo; How To Check Your Pages Use Search Console&rsquo;s URL Inspection to review the rendered HTML and confirm that above-the-fold images and lazy-loaded modules resolve to standard attributes. Avoid relying on the screenshot. Splitt advised: &ldquo;If the rendered HTML looks like it contains all the image URLs in the source attribute of an image tag ... then you will be fine.&rdquo; Ranking Impact Splitt framed ranking effects as modest. Core Web Vitals contribute to ranking, but he called it &ldquo;a tiny minute factor in most cases.&rdquo; What You Should Do Next Keep hero and other above-the-fold images eager with width and height set. Use native loading=\"lazy\" for below-the-fold images and iframes. If you rely on a library for previews, videos, or dynamic sections, make sure the final markup exposes real URLs in standard attributes, and confirm in rendered HTML. Looking Ahead Lazy loading is useful when applied selectively. Treat it as an opt-in for noncritical content. Verify your implementation with rendered HTML, and watch how your LCP trends over time.

    "essence": "Google Confirms New Google Verified Badge for Local Services Ads Google is launching the Google Verified badge in October 2025, replacing multiple Local Services Ads trust signals with one simplified identity for advertisers. Google is rolling out the new Google Verified badge in October 2025 for Local Services Ads. The update replaces multiple trust signals, including Google Guaranteed and Google Screened, with one unified identity. Advertisers should review eligibility now and maintain verification to protect visibility and consumer trust. VIP CONTRIBUTOR Brooke Osmundson August 21, 2025 ⋅ 3 min read VIP CONTRIBUTOR Brooke Osmundson Director of Growth Marketing at Smith Micro Software Bio Follow 1.7K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Google just announced a new unifying identity for its Local Services Ads (LSAs) verification badges. Called Google Verified, the badge will replace several different trust signals that advertisers and consumers have been seeing over the years. This includes the Google Guaranteed, Google Screened, License Verified by Google, and the Money Back Guarantee program. Starting in October 2025, eligible LSAs that pass the necessary screenings will display this streamlined mark: a single badge designed to communicate credibility in a more consistent way. Why is Google Consolidating Badges? In the past, Google&rsquo;s verification system was fragmented. Different types of businesses had different badges, and consumers were left guessing what each one actually meant. Was a &ldquo;Screened&rdquo; provider more trustworthy than a &ldquo;Guaranteed&rdquo; one? Did a license verification carry more weight than a money-back promise? The lack of consistency made it harder for advertisers to explain their value and for consumers to make decisions. By rolling everything into one identity, Google Verified aims to simplify the process for everyone involved. The badge will not only appear across Local Service Ads but will also include transparency for consumers. When a user taps or hovers over the badge, they can see the specific checks a business has passed. How Does This Change Impact Advertisers? For marketers and business owners, the simplified badge system removes some of the confusion around what signals matter. Instead of juggling multiple programs, the message is now clear: your business is either Google Verified, or it&rsquo;s not. That said, the bar for participation may feel higher. Businesses that don&rsquo;t keep their documentation, licensing, and other requirements up to date risk losing the badge. Since Google has indicated it may only show the badge when it predicts it will help users make decisions, credibility and visibility could become even more closely linked. In short, advertisers who maintain verification stand to benefit from increased trust, while those who lag behind could see their ads appear less competitive. This update doesn&rsquo;t require marketers to overhaul their entire strategy by any means. However, there are a few practical steps you can take to ensure a smooth transition by October. Review eligibility now. Make sure your licenses, insurance, and background checks are up-to-date before October. Build in reminders. Treat verification like an ongoing compliance process, not a one-time task. Educate clients or internal teams. If you manage LSA campaigns for others, help them understand that the badge isn&rsquo;t just a cosmetic update. It reflects ongoing credibility. Monitor performance post-launch. Once the new badge rolls out, watch for shifts in click-thru rate (CTR) and conversion rates. If verification gives a measurable lift, you&rsquo;ll want to highlight that value in your reporting. A Shift Toward Ongoing Trust Google Verified may look like a rebrand on the surface, but it&rsquo;s also a signal that trust in digital advertising is moving toward continuous validation. For businesses, this means credibility is not something you earn once; it&rsquo;s something you prove over and over again. For advertisers, the key takeaway is simple: don&rsquo;t treat this as a one-time update. Verification will become an expectation, not a nice-to-have, and it could influence not just how consumers view your ads but how often those ads are shown. Category News PPC",

    "essence": "Semantic Overlap Vs. Density: Finding The Balance That Wins Retrieval Learning how to balance semantic density and semantic overlap is essential for machine retrieval and for readers Duane Forrester August 21, 2025 ⋅ 8 min read Duane Forrester Founder and CEO at UnboundAnswers.com Bio Follow 26 SHARES 2.0K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Marketers today spend their time on keyword research to uncover opportunities, closing content gaps, making sure pages are crawlable, and aligning content with E-E-A-T principles . Those things still matter. But in a world where generative AI increasingly mediates information, they are not enough. The difference now is retrieval. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how polished or authoritative your content looks to a human if the machine never pulls it into the answer set. Retrieval isn&rsquo;t just about whether your page exists or whether it&rsquo;s technically optimized. It&rsquo;s about how machines interpret the meaning inside your words. That brings us to two factors most people don&rsquo;t think about much, but which are quickly becoming essential: semantic density and semantic overlap . They&rsquo;re closely related, often confused, but in practice, they drive very different outcomes in GenAI retrieval. Understanding them, and learning how to balance them, may help shape the future of content optimization. Think of them as part of the new on-page optimization layer. Image Credit:: Duane Forrester Density Vs. Overlap: Definitions And Why They Split Semantic density is about meaning per token. A dense block of text communicates maximum information in the fewest possible words. Think of a crisp definition in a glossary or a tightly written executive summary. Humans tend to like dense content because it signals authority, saves time, and feels efficient. Semantic overlap is different. Overlap measures how well your content aligns with a model&rsquo;s latent representation of a query. Retrieval engines don&rsquo;t read like humans. They encode meaning into vectors and compare similarities. If your chunk of content shares many of the same signals as the query embedding, it gets retrieved. If it doesn&rsquo;t, it stays invisible, no matter how elegant the prose. This concept is already formalized in natural language processing (NLP) evaluation. One of the most widely used measures is BERTScore ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675 ), introduced by researchers in 2020. It compares the embeddings of two texts, such as a query and a response, and produces a similarity score that reflects semantic overlap. BERTScore is not a Google SEO tool. It&rsquo;s an open-source metric rooted in the BERT model family, originally developed by Google Research, and has become a standard way to evaluate alignment in natural language processing. Now, here&rsquo;s where things split. Humans reward density. Machines reward overlap. A dense sentence may be admired by readers but skipped by the machine if it doesn&rsquo;t overlap with the query vector. A longer passage that repeats synonyms, rephrases questions, and surfaces related entities may look redundant to people, but it aligns more strongly with the query and wins retrieval. In the keyword era of SEO, density and overlap were blurred together under optimization practices. Writing naturally while including enough variations of a keyword often achieved both. In GenAI retrieval, the two diverge. Optimizing for one doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the other. This distinction is recognized in evaluation frameworks already used in machine learning. BERTScore, for example, shows that a higher score means greater alignment with the intended meaning. That overlap matters far more for retrieval than density alone. And if you really want to deep-dive into LLM evaluation metrics, this article is a great resource. How Retrieval Works: Chunks, Embeddings, And Alignment Generative systems don&rsquo;t ingest and retrieve entire webpages. They work with chunks. Large language models are paired with vector databases in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. When a query comes in, it is converted into an embedding. That embedding is compared against a library of content embeddings. The system doesn&rsquo;t ask &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the best-written page?&rdquo; It asks &ldquo;which chunks live closest to this query in vector space?&rdquo; This is why semantic overlap matters more than density. The retrieval layer is blind to elegance. It prioritizes alignment and coherence through similarity scores. Chunk size and structure add complexity. Too small, and a dense chunk may miss overlap signals and get passed over. Too large, and a verbose chunk may rank well but frustrate users with bloat once it&rsquo;s surfaced. The art is in balancing compact meaning with overlap cues, structuring chunks so they are both semantically aligned and easy to read once retrieved. Practitioners often test chunk sizes between 200 and 500 tokens and 800 and 1,000 tokens to find the balance that fits their domain and query patterns. Microsoft Research offers a striking example. In a 2025 study analyzing 200,000 anonymized Bing Copilot conversations, researchers found that information gathering and writing tasks scored highest in both retrieval success and user satisfaction. Retrieval success didn&rsquo;t track with compactness of response; it tracked with overlap between the model&rsquo;s understanding of the query and the phrasing used in the response. In fact, in 40% of conversations, the overlap between the user&rsquo;s goal and the AI&rsquo;s action was asymmetric. Retrieval happened where overlap was high, even when density was not. Full study here . This reflects a structural truth of retrieval-augmented systems. Overlap, not brevity, is what gets you in the answer set. Dense text without alignment is invisible. Verbose text with alignment can surface. The retrieval engine cares more about embedding similarity. This isn&rsquo;t just theory. Semantic search practitioners already measure quality through intent-alignment metrics rather than keyword frequency. For example, Milvus, a leading open-source vector database, highlights overlap-based metrics as the right way to evaluate semantic search performance. Their reference guide emphasizes matching semantic meaning over surface forms. The lesson is clear. Machines don&rsquo;t reward you for elegance. They reward you for alignment. There&rsquo;s also a shift in how we think about structure needed here. Most people see bullet points as shorthand; quick, scannable fragments. That works for humans, but machines read them differently. To a retrieval system, a bullet is a structural signal that defines a chunk. What matters is the overlap inside that chunk. A short, stripped-down bullet may look clean but carry little alignment. A longer, richer bullet, one that repeats key entities, includes synonyms, and phrases ideas in multiple ways, has a higher chance of retrieval. In practice, that means bullets may need to be fuller and more detailed than we&rsquo;re used to writing. Brevity doesn&rsquo;t get you into the answer set. Overlap does. Toward A Composite Metric: Why We Need Density And Overlap Together If overlap drives retrieval, does that mean density doesn&rsquo;t matter? Not at all. Overlap gets you retrieved. Density keeps you credible. Once your chunk is surfaced, a human still has to read it. If that reader finds it bloated, repetitive, or sloppy, your authority erodes. The machine decides visibility. The human decides trust. What&rsquo;s missing today is a composite metric that balances both. We can imagine two scores: Semantic Density Score: This measures meaning per token, evaluating how efficiently information is conveyed. This could be approximated by compression ratios, readability formulas, or even human scoring. Semantic Overlap Score: This measures how strongly a chunk aligns with a query embedding. This is already approximated by tools like BERTScore or cosine similarity in vector space. Together, these two measures give us a fuller picture. A piece of content with a high density score but low overlap reads beautifully, but may never be retrieved. A piece with a high overlap score but low density may be retrieved constantly, but frustrate readers. The winning strategy is aiming for both. Imagine two short passages answering the same query: Dense version: &ldquo;RAG systems retrieve chunks of data relevant to a query and feed them to an LLM.&rdquo; Overlap version: &ldquo;Retrieval-augmented generation, often called RAG, retrieves relevant content chunks, compares their embeddings to the user&rsquo;s query, and passes the aligned chunks to a large language model for generating an answer.&rdquo; Both are factually correct. The first is compact and clear. The second is wordier, repeats key entities, and uses synonyms. The dense version scores higher with humans. The overlap version scores higher with machines. Which one gets retrieved more often? The overlap version. Which one earns trust once retrieved? The dense one. Let&rsquo;s consider a non-technical example. Dense version: &ldquo;Vitamin D regulates calcium and bone health.&rdquo; Overlap‑rich version: &ldquo;Vitamin D, also called calciferol, supports calcium absorption, bone growth, and bone density, helping prevent conditions such as osteoporosis.&rdquo; Both are correct. The second includes synonyms and related concepts, which increases overlap and the likelihood of retrieval. This Is Why The Future Of Optimization Is Not Choosing Density Or Overlap, It&rsquo;s Balancing Both Just as the early days of SEO saw metrics like keyword density and backlinks evolve into more sophisticated measures of authority, the next wave will hopefully formalize density and overlap scores into standard optimization dashboards. For now, it remains a balancing act. If you choose overlap, it&rsquo;s likely a safe-ish bet, as at least it gets you retrieved. Then, you have to hope the people reading your content as an answer find it engaging enough to stick around. The machine decides if you are visible. The human decides if you are trusted. Semantic density sharpens meaning. Semantic overlap wins retrieval. The work is balancing both, then watching how readers engage, so you can keep improving.

What&rsquo;s New Booking Reservations AI Mode can interpret a detailed request, check real-time availability across reservation sites, and link you to the booking page to complete the task. For businesses, that shifts more discovery and conversion activity inside Google&rsquo;s surfaces. Robby Stein wrote on The Keyword: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re starting to roll out today with finding restaurant reservations, and expanding soon to local service appointments and event tickets.&rdquo; Screenshot from: blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-agentic-personalized/, August 2025. Planning Features Google is introducing planning features that make results easier to share and tailor queries. In the U.S., you can share an AI Mode response with others so they can ask follow-ups and continue research on their own, and you can revoke the link at any time. Screenshot from: blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-agentic-personalized/, August 2025. Separately, U.S. users who opt in to the Labs experiment can receive personalized dining suggestions informed by prior conversations and interactions in Search and Maps, with controls in Google Account settings. How It Works Under the hood, Google cites live web browsing via Project Mariner, partner integrations, and signals from the Knowledge Graph and Maps. Named partners include OpenTable, Resy, Tock, Ticketmaster, StubHub, SeatGeek, and Booksy. Dining is first; local services and ticketing are next on the roadmap. Availability Availability is gated. Agentic reservations are limited to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. through the &ldquo;Agentic capabilities in AI Mode&rdquo; Labs experiment. Personalization is U.S. and opt-in, with dining topics first. Link sharing is available in the U.S. Global access to AI Mode is expanding to more than 180 countries and territories in English, with additional languages planned. Looking Ahead AI Mode is moving from answer generation to task completion. If your category relies on reservation or ticketing partners, verify inventory accuracy, hours, and policies now, and make sure your structured data and Business Profile attributes are clean. Track how bookings and referrals appear in analytics as Google widens coverage to more tasks and regions. Category News Generative AI",

    "essence": "Ask An SEO: Should Small Brands Go All In On TikTok For Audience Growth? Don’t build your brand around a single channel. Here’s a smarter framework for growth that avoids platform tunnel vision. Mordy Oberstein August 21, 2025 ⋅ 8 min read Mordy Oberstein Founder at Unify Brand Marketing Bio Follow 1.7K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> This week&rsquo;s Ask An SEO question is about whether small brands should prioritize TikTok over Google to grow their audience: &ldquo;I keep hearing that TikTok is a better platform for small brands with an easier route to an audience. Do you think that Google is still relevant, or should I go all in on TikTok?&rdquo; The short answer to your question is that you do not want to pigeonhole your business into one channel, no matter the size. There&rsquo;s also no such thing as an &ldquo;easier&rdquo; way. They are all hard. I&rsquo;m going to get the obvious out of the way so we can get to something beyond the usual answers to this question. Your brand should be where your audience is. Great, now that we didn&rsquo;t spend four paragraphs saying the same thing that&rsquo;s been said 100 times before, let me tell you something you want to consider beyond &ldquo;be where your audience is.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s Not About Channel, It&rsquo;s About Traction I have a lot of opinions here, so let me just &ldquo;channel&rdquo; my inner Big Lebowski and preface this with ... this is just my opinion, man. Stop thinking about channels. That&rsquo;s way down the funnel (yet marketers make channels the seminal question all the time). Start thinking about traction. How do you generate the most traction? When I say &ldquo;traction,&rdquo; what I really mean is how to start resonating with your audience so that the &ldquo;chatter&rdquo; and momentum about who you are compound so that new doors of opportunity open up. The answer to that question is not, &ldquo;We will focus on TikTok.&rdquo; The answer is also not, &ldquo;We will focus on Google.&rdquo; The answer is also not, &ldquo;We will focus on YouTube.&rdquo; I could go on. Now, there is another side to this: resources and operations. The question is, how do you balance traction with the amount of resources you have? For smaller brands, I would think about: What can you do to gain traction that bigger brands have a hard time with? For example, big brands have a very hard time with video content . They have all sorts of production standards, operations, and a litany of people who have a say, who shouldn&rsquo;t even be in sniffing distance of having a say. They can&rsquo;t simply turn on their phone, record a video, and share something of value. You can. Does that mean you should focus on TikTok? Nope. It means you should think about what you can put out there that would resonate and help your audience, and does that work for the format? If so, you may want to go with video shorts . I&rsquo;m not sure why you would limit that to just TikTok. Also, if your age demographic is not on TikTok, don&rsquo;t do that. (&ldquo;Being where your audience is&rdquo; is a fundamental truth. Although I think the question is more about being in tune with your audience overall than &ldquo;being where they are.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re attuned to your audience, then you would know where they are and where to go just naturally.) I&rsquo;ll throw another example at you. Big brands have a hard time communicating with honesty, transparency, and a basic level of authenticity. As a result, a lot of their content is &ldquo;stale,&rdquo; at best. In this instance, trying to generate traction and even traffic by writing more authentic content that speaks to your audience, and not at them, seems quite reasonable. In other words, the question is, &ldquo;What resonates with your audience and what opportunities can you seize that bigger brands can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a framework. It&rsquo;s what resonates + what resources do you have + what vulnerabilities do the bigger brands in your vertical have that you can capitalize on. There&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all answer to that. Forget your audience for a second, where are the vulnerabilities of the bigger brands in your space? They might be super-focused on TikTok and have figured out all of the production hurdles I mentioned earlier, but they might not be focused on text-based content in a healthy way, if at all. Is TikTok &ldquo;easier&rdquo; in that scenario? Maybe not. Don&rsquo;t Pigeonhole Yourself Every platform has its idiosyncrasies. One of the problems with going all-in on a platform is that your brand adopts those idiosyncrasies. If I were all about Google traffic, my brand might sound like (as too many do) &ldquo;SEO content.&rdquo; Across the board. It all seeps through. The problem with &ldquo;channels&rdquo; to me is that it produces a mindset of &ldquo;optimizing&rdquo; for the channel. When that happens – which inevitably it does (just look at all the SEO content on the web) – the only way out is very painful. While you might start with the right mindset, it&rsquo;s very easy to lose your brand&rsquo;s actual voice along the way. That can pigeonhole your brand&rsquo;s ability to maneuver as time goes on. For starters, one day what you had on TikTok may no longer exist (I&rsquo;m just using TikTok as an example). Your audience may evolve and grow older with you, and move to other forms of content consumption. The TikTok algorithm may gobble up your reach one day. Who knows. What I am saying is, it is possible to wake up one day and what you had with a specific channel doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore. That&rsquo;s a real problem. That very real problem gets compounded if your overarching brand voice is impacted by your channel approach. Which it often is. Now, you have to reinvent the wheel, so to speak. Now, you have to adjust your channel approach (and never leave all your eggs in one basket), and you have to find your actual voice again. This whole time, you were focused on speaking to a channel and what the channel demanded (i.e., the algorithm) and not your audience. All of this is why I recommend a &ldquo;traction-focused&rdquo; approach. If you&rsquo;re focused on traction, then this whole time, you&rsquo;ve been building yourself up to become less and less reliant on the channel. If you&rsquo;re focused on traction, which inherently focuses on resonance, people start to come to you. You become a destination that people seek out, or, at a minimum, are familiar with. That leaves you less vulnerable to changes within a specific channel. It also helps you perform better across other channels. When you resonate and people start to recognize you, it makes performing easier (and less costly). Let&rsquo;s play it out. You start creating material for TikTok, but you do it with a traction, not a channel mindset. The content you produce starts to resonate. People start talking about you, tagging you on social, mentioning you in articles, etc. All of that would, in theory, help your web content become more visible within organic search and your brand overall more visible in large language models (LLMs), no? Let&rsquo;s play it out even more. One day, TikTok shuts down. Now, you have to switch channels (old TV reference). If you focused more on traction: You should have more direct traffic or branded search traffic than you had when you started your &ldquo;TikTok-ing.&rdquo; You should have more cache to rank better if you decide to create content for Google Search (just as an example). The opposite is true as well. If Google shut down one day, and you had to move to TikTok, you would: Have more direct traffic than when you started to focus on Google. Have more cache and awareness to start building a following on TikTok. It&rsquo;s all one song. Changing The Channel I feel like, and this is a bit of a controversial take (for some reason), the less you &ldquo;focus&rdquo; on channels, the better. The more you see a channel as less of a strategy and more of a way to actualize the traction you&rsquo;re looking to create, the better off you&rsquo;ll be. You&rsquo;ll also have an easier time answering questions like &ldquo;Which channel is better?&rdquo;. To reiterate: Don&rsquo;t lose your brand voice to any channel. Build up traction (resonance) so that when a channel changes, you&rsquo;re not stuck. Build up traction so that you already have cache when pivoting to the new channel. It&rsquo;s better to be a destination than anything. All of this depends on your vertical, your resources, your competition, and most importantly, what your audience needs from you. The moment you think beyond &ldquo;channels&rdquo; is the moment you start operating with a bit more clarity about channels. (It&rsquo;s a kind of &ldquo;there is no spoon&rdquo; sort of thing.)

    "essence": "Common Hosting Defenses Ineffective Against WordPress Threats Case study shows that general web hosting security, including Cloudflare WAF, is ineffective against WordPress-specific threats. SEJ STAFF Roger Montti August 21, 2025 ⋅ 5 min read SEJ STAFF Roger Montti Owner - Martinibuster.com at Martinibuster.com Bio Follow 24 SHARES 6.2K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Patchstack published a case study that examined how well Cloudflare and other general firewall and malware solutions protected WordPress websites from common vulnerability threats and attack vectors. The research showed that while general solutions stopped threats like SQL injection or cross-site scripting, a dedicated WordPress security solution consistently stopped WordPress-specific exploits at a significantly higher rate. WordPress Vulnerabilities Due to the popularity of the WordPress platform, WordPress plugins and themes are a common focus for hackers, and vulnerabilities can quickly be exploited in the wild. Once proof-of-concept code is public, attackers often act within hours, leaving website owners little time to react. This is why it is critical to be aware of the security provided by a web host and of how effective those solutions are in a WordPress environment. Methodology Patchstack explained their methodology: &ldquo;As a baseline, we have decided to host &ldquo;honeypot&rdquo; sites (sites against which we will perform controlled pentesting with a set of 11 WordPress-specific vulnerabilities) with 5 distinct hosting providers, some of which have ingrained features presuming to help with blocking WordPress vulnerabilities and/or overall security. In addition to the hosting provider&rsquo;s security measures and third-party providers for additional measures like robust WAFs or other patching providers, we have also installed Patchstack on every site, with our test question being: How many of these threats will bypass firewalls and other patching providers to ultimately reach Patchstack? And will Patchstack be able to block them all successfully?&rdquo; Testing process Each website was set up the same way, with identical plugins, versions, and settings. Patchstack used a &ldquo;exploitation testing toolkit&rdquo; to run the same exploit tests in the same order on every site. Results were checked automatically and by hand to see if attacks were stopped, and whether the block came from the host&rsquo;s defenses or from Patchstack. General Overview: Hosting Providers Versus Vulnerabilities The Patchstack case study tested five different configurations of security defenses, plus Patchstack. 1. Hosting Provider A Plus Cloudflare WAF 2. Hosting Provider B + Firewall + Monarx Server and Website Security 3. Hosting Provider C + Firewall + Imunify Web Server Security 4. Hosting Provider D + ConfigServer Firewall 5. Hosting Provider E + Firewall The result of the testing showed that the various hosting infrastructure defenses failed to protect the majority of WordPress-specific threats, catching only 12.2% of the exploits. Patchstack caught 100% of all exploits. Patchstack shared: &ldquo;2 out of the 5 hosts and their solutions failed to block any vulnerabilities at the network and server levels. 1 host blocked 1 vulnerability out of 11. 1 host blocked 2 vulnerabilities out of 11. 1 host blocked 4 vulnerabilities out of 11.&rdquo; Cloudflare And Other Solutions Failed Solutions like Cloudflare WAF or bundled services such as Monarx or Imunify failed to consistently address WordPress specific vulnerabilities. Cloudflare&rsquo;s WAF stopped 4 of 11 exploits, Monarx blocked none, and Imunify did not prevent any WordPress-specific exploits. Firewalls such as ConfigServer, which are widely used in shared hosting environments, also failed every test. These results show that while those kinds of products work reasonably well against broad attack types, they are not tuned to the specific security issues common to WordPress plugins and themes. Patchstack is created to specifically stop WordPress plugin and theme vulnerabilities in real time. Instead of relying on static signatures or generic rules, it applies targeted mitigation through virtual patches as soon as vulnerabilities are disclosed, before attackers can act. Virtual patches are mitigation for a specific WordPress vulnerability. This offers protection to users while a plugin or theme developer can create a patch for the flaw. This approach addresses WordPress flaws in a way hosting companies and generic tools can&rsquo;t because they rarely match generic attack patterns, so they slip past traditional defenses and expose publishers to privilege escalation, authentication bypasses, and site takeovers. Takeaways Standard hosting defenses fail against most WordPress plugin vulnerabilities (87.8% bypass rate). Many providers claiming &ldquo;virtual patching&rdquo; (like Monarx and Imunify) did not stop WordPress-specific exploits. Generic firewalls and WAFs caught some broad attacks (SQLi, XSS) but not WordPress-specific flaws tied to plugins and themes. Patchstack consistently blocked vulnerabilities in real time, filling the gap left by network and server defenses. WordPress&rsquo;s plugin-heavy ecosystem makes it an especially attractive target for attackers, making effective vulnerability protection essential. The case study by Patchstack shows that traditional hosting defenses and generic &ldquo;virtual patching&rdquo; solutions leave WordPress sites vulnerable, with nearly 88% of attacks bypassing firewalls and server-layer protections. While providers like Cloudflare blocked some broad exploits, plugin-specific threats such as privilege escalation and authentication bypasses slipped through. Patchstack was the only solution to consistently block these attacks in real time, giving site owners a dependable way to protect WordPress sites against the types of vulnerabilities that are most often targeted by attackers. According to Patchstack: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rely on generic defenses for WordPress. Patchstack is built to detect and block these threats in real-time, applying mitigation rules before attackers can exploit them.&rdquo; Read the results of the case study by Patchstack here .

    "essence": "Home Marketing Here’s why your next newsletter isn’t going to spam Here’s why your next newsletter isn’t going to spam Email deliverability pro Al Iverson's 3 top tips Written by: Laura M. Browning MASTERS IN MARKETING No fluff, only first-hand expert advice and curated marketing trends from across the web. Subscribe Now Updated: 08/18/25 At my last job I was tasked with launching a newsletter, and was suddenly faced with a bunch of unfamiliar acronyms: DKIM, DMARC, SPF. (Apparently that last one is not related to sun protection?) So I texted Al Iverson (not the basketball player), who’s been working in email deliverability since the dawn of mainstream internet, and asked if he could help me figure out what I really needed to know. Since you (probably) don’t have Al Iverson’s phone number, I chatted with him last week about email deliverability, owned audience, and windmills. Meet the Master Al Iverson Industry research and community engagement lead, Valimail , and Deliverability consultant and publisher, Spam Resource Claim to fame: Al’s been working in email deliverability since before the term even existed, including a 15-year stint at Salesforce as its director of deliverability. Fun fact: He programmed all the computers in his high school’s Mac lab to play “Stayin’ Alive” for alerts instead of beeping. Old-school Macs couldn’t multitask while beeping; you had to listen to the entire 4-minute song. Lesson 1: Audience engagement has a technical component. “Every once in a while, you run into something really strange, like Microsoft blocking emails that have the word ‘windmill’ in the subject line,” Iverson says. “Did you say windmill ? Like … Dutch windmills?” I ask, making sure I’ve heard him correctly. “We have no idea why,” he says, and I certainly can’t begin to guess. [ Iverson clarified for me later that this is a fictional example, meant to represent how odd spam-filtering can be, and why you shouldn't get too hung up on specific words. You're safe, windmill fans!—ed. ] But “Free!” and “Buy now!” are probably okay, he tells me, further scrambling my brain.. Even more counterintuitively, Iverson says that using a swear word in a subject line isn’t necessarily a guaranteed trip to the spam filter anymore. The real lesson here isn’t about some quixotic pursuit of The Ideal Email, it’s that there are persistent myths in email deliverability — and it pays for you to get acquainted with them. For starters, Iverson suggests a healthy skepticism of any “top 200 words to avoid in your subject line” lists. And Gmail “wants to make sure that the subject line and sender information actually connect to what's in the body of the email,” so it’s “actually very sensitive” to outdated ideas like starting a bulk email with “Re:.” In other words: Pay as much attention to the technical side of audience engagement as you are to creating excellent content. Lesson 2: Own your identity. “Why do people love email so much?” Iverson asks. “Because it is a platform that is open to all.” Platforms like Instagram and TikTok — aside from needing some basic video editing and possibly dance skills — are owned by corporate entities out of your control. Although individual email platforms like Gmail have a lot of influence when it comes to deliverability, your email audience is your own. And, says Iverson, email “gives us this channel to connect with people without being beholden to these specific platforms.” The flip side of that is that “if you don't have the technical ability to take control of those levers that put it more into your control, you can still get similarly stuck.” If you’re new to email newsletters, any one of the major platforms is a great place to start. But the more technical know-how you have (or can hire), the more you can do things like sending from your own domain, putting you just a little bit more “in control of your own destiny, both from a deliverability perspective and from a long-term branding and marketing perspective.” Lesson 3: Stop chasing subscriber count. “People live and die by their subscriber counts,” Iverson says. But “if you have 10 million subscribers, but a very low open rate, your emails are more likely to go to the spam folder.” The primary reason that an otherwise good newsletter might land in the spam folder is lack of engagement. “The more you focus on people who are actually interested enough to interact with your mail, the better reputation you have with the mailbox providers, so you're more likely to get to the inbox,” he says. “And, long story short, what prevents spam folder placement isn’t how many subscribers you have — it’s high engagement.” Maximize high engagement by “implementing a subscriber lifecycle management process,” says Iverson. Suppressing inactive subscribers, segmenting your audience, and being transparent about your practices are all key to your newsletter’s ultimate success. Lingering Questions This Week’s Question If you could only invest in one tool to help your company grow for the next three years, what tool would it be? —Ryan Atkinson, Founder and CEO of Spacebar Visuals This Week’s Answer Iverson: In the context of email marketing success, inbox placement, and deliverability, this means investing in a deliverability testing and monitoring platform (like Inbox Monster, for example). If your revenue depends on successful email marketing, you’re running blind without something like this. Whether your email gets to the inbox isn’t something you can easily track on an email marketing platform; there’s no “which folder” disposition information sent back to the sender or send platform as part of the email delivery process. A tool like this, and the expertise that comes with it, guides you on how to interpret results and make strategic adjustments to remediate or prevent issues. Next Week’s Lingering Question Iverson asks: What's one marketing habit or best practice you think we should collectively leave behind, and what would you replace it with?
