    "essence": "ChatGPT Vs. Google At Every Stage Of The User Journey New Similarweb data shows the insane growth of ChatGPT and how different user behavior impacts downstream metrics. VIP CONTRIBUTOR Kevin Indig 22 seconds ago ⋅ 8 min read VIP CONTRIBUTOR Kevin Indig Growth Advisor Bio Follow { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Boost your skills with Growth Memo&rsquo;s weekly expert insights. Subscribe for free ! More data shows ChatGPT isn&rsquo;t taking market share away from Google. Instead, it&rsquo;s expanding the range of use cases and blurring the line between searching for information and performing tasks. I looked at Similarweb data to understand how this affects four different stages of the user journey across Google and ChatGPT: Usage. Behavior. Outbound clicks. Converting. What I found is that ChatGPT adoption is, essentially, a 400,000-pound locomotive barreling down the tracks with no intention of stopping anytime soon. User conversations within ChatGPT are rich in context, which leads to higher conversion rates when intent shifts from information seeking or generating to buying. Lastly, and also most notably for SEOs and growth marketers, ChatGPT is sending a lot more users out to the web. Of course, all of these stats are still small in comparison to Google. However, no effort from Google has been able to slow the momentum of ChatGPT&rsquo;s runaway train. About the data I used in this analysis: Data source: Similarweb (shoutout to Sam Sheridan). Time period examined: July 2024 – June 2025 (last 12 months) vs. July 2023 – June 2024 (previous 12 months). I also examined U.S. vs. UK user behavior. Image Credit Kevin Indig Visits: ChatGPT Is Growing At Rapid Pace People are rushing to ChatGPT. Over the last 12 months in the U.S., ChatGPT visits grew from 3.5 to 6.8 billion visits (+94%). In the UK, it was even faster: 131% YoY, from 868 million to 2 billion. Over the same time span, Google growth stagnated. Here&rsquo;s what the data showed: U.S. stagnation: -0.85% (196 vs. 194 billion). UK stagnation: -0.22% (35.56 vs. 35.49 billion). Image Credit: Kevin Indig To put it into perspective: Google had almost 200 billion visits in the U.S. over the last 12 months, compared to ChatGPT&rsquo;s 6.8 billion. So, ChatGPT has a mere 3.4% of Google&rsquo;s total visits. However, if growth rates hold steady, in theory, ChatGPT could hit Google&rsquo;s volume in the next five years. My hypothesis: It&rsquo;s almost guaranteed that ChatGPT won&rsquo;t hit Google&rsquo;s visit volume because there are too many moving parts (energy/chip limitations, training data, quality improvements, regulation, etc.). But consider that Google has declined by -0.85% (~2 billion visits) year-over-year, and you can see where this is going. Visits can only tell you so much. Recent data from Semrush and Profound suggests that one-third to two-thirds of user intent when interacting with AI chatbots is generative, meaning users use ChatGPT to do and less to search [ 1 , 2 ] . Leaked chats from ChatGPT and other AI chatbots confirm the aggregate data. So, even when we compare visits to ChatGPT vs. Google, they&rsquo;re not leading to the same outcome. But, against that argument, I will say that Google morphs more into a mirror of ChatGPT with AI Mode – and every generative intent has a high chance of including information along the conversation journey that is sourced to other sites or creators. The conversational nature of AI chatbots means intent is fluid and can change from one prompt to the next. Along the way, it&rsquo;s likely users come across information in their conversations that would&rsquo;ve been a classic Google Search for products or solutions. At the end of the day, ChatGPT is continuing its adoption as the fastest-growing product on earth to date. What does that mean for you? Stay the course. Keep tracking referral traffic, conversions, and topic visibility on Google + ChatGPT. Optimize for visibility with a strong focus on classic SEO. Keep an ear to the ground and learn as much as you can. Things are evolving fast, and clarity will come with time. Quick reminder here: I recently transitioned my WhatsApp group over to Slack. I share ongoing news and learnings throughout the week openly and freely, so it&rsquo;s a great place to stay updated without all the extra (and sometimes overwhelming) noise. No need to be a premium subscriber to get access to the main discussion channel. Join here ! On The Platform: User Behavior Context Is Rich Old habits are hard to break. People are used to searching on Google a certain way, while ChatGPT is a green field. For the overwhelming majority of us, our first experience with ChatGPT was a conversation, so we all adopted it as the default way to engage. Image Credit: Kevin Indig As a result, the average query prompt length on ChatGPT vs. Google is: 80 words vs 3.4 in the U.S. 91 words vs. 3.2 in the UK. Even informational prompts are 10 times longer (~38 words) on ChatGPT than on Google. People ask more detailed questions, which reveal much more about themselves and their intent. Together with a growing context window, ChatGPT returns much more personalized and (usually) better informational answers – I&rsquo;m still waiting on consistently better commercial/purchase intent outcomes. [ 3 ] AI chatbots compress the user journey from many queries over several days to one conversation with lengthy prompts. For you, this means it&rsquo;s even more critical to monitor the right prompts. (I shared a trick with premium subscribers for finding prompts in Google Search Console from AI Mode in Is AI cutting into your SEO conversions? ) Referral Traffic: Outgoing ChatGPT Traffic Grew By 723% In The US As referral traffic from Google reached historic lows, ChatGPT&rsquo;s referral traffic reached new highs. Image Credit: Kevin Indig Over the last 12 months, ChatGPT&rsquo;s U.S. referral traffic to websites jumped by +3,496% (UK: +5,950%), from 14 to 516 million (after cleaning up referrals to Openai.com, which are mostly authentications). In comparison, Google&rsquo;s outgoing referral visits grew only +23% in the U.S. and 19% in the UK. When you consider Google referrals include navigational searches (people navigating to the homepage of a brand) and ad clicks (ChatGPT doesn&rsquo;t yet have ads), 23% is not much at all. ChatGPT&rsquo;s referral traffic to external websites makes up ~27% of Google&rsquo;s (1.9 billion, in the last 12 months), based on the data. That feels high, in my field observation. Also consider that ChatGPT&rsquo;s goal is not necessarily to send out traffic but to keep the conversation going until users have the optimal response. That being said, referral traffic has grown and continues to do so. Until recently. According to Profound, ChatGPT&rsquo;s referral traffic was down -52% between July 21 and August 20. [ 4 ] And that&rsquo;s significant. Time will tell whether this is just an experiment or a final decision. For you, this means you should see more ChatGPT referral traffic over the last 12 months if you optimize well. You might not see an increase of +3,500%, but if you&rsquo;re not seeing at least some growth, it&rsquo;s likely your competitors are. Conversions: ChatGPT > Google Conversions from ChatGPT are small in comparison with Google (in volume), but they&rsquo;re growing rapidly. The whole narrative of investing in AI visibility optimization (AEO/GEO/LLMO) banks on the fact that it will continue at the same pace and become meaningful. So far, it seems like that bet will work out. Image Credit: Kevin Indig When ChatGPT sends traffic to sites, the conversion rate is usually higher than Google&rsquo;s. As of June 2025: ChatGPT&rsquo;s conversion rate of transactional traffic was 6.9% in the U.S. compared to 5.4% for Google. In the UK, ChatGPT reached 5.5%, which is on par with Google. ChatGPT sends higher-quality traffic to websites, at least in the U.S. I define quality in this context as &ldquo;higher intent,&rdquo; meaning visitors are more likely to convert into customers. The reason ChatGPT traffic is of higher quality is that users get answers to their questions in one conversation. When they click out, they&rsquo;re &ldquo;primed&rdquo; to buy. To me, the bigger question is how purchase decisions are influenced before a click happens (or even when no click-out happens). For you, this means: Look at which pages get referral traffic. Take the average referral traffic and optimize pages that get some but below-average clicks. Optimizing for citations matters because citations are what get clicked. Look at the citation gap between your competitors and your site. Look for conversion optimization opportunities (in-line CTAs, lead gen assets, quizzes, etc) on pages that get ChatGPT referral traffic. Using a standard heatmap tool will point you to areas of the page that are ideal for a little CRO. Bringing It All Together ChatGPT has all the ingredients to become the next big user platform on which other companies can build – just like Google 25 years ago: Usage is growing. Behavior is rich in context. Referral traffic is shooting up. Conversions happen at a healthy rate. Now, traffic and conversations just need more volume. They&rsquo;re still tiny in comparison.

What would you do to beat the industry leader? Question I am a bit upset with this whole marketing world... Maybe I am just jealous... Case studies are often rigged - in terms of big corps have the power to \"push through\" SEO, Google Ads easily, and can test everything with their \"endless\" money. For, little brands, they have to hack everything and figure out what works on a lower scale... E.g. if you want to launch a Pmax campaign, but in a very, very niche IT security B2B enterprise market, and the competitor has 100x more resources, and they do not need leads from Google Ads they are just there to brand themselves - but because of this, the price is so high that you can not test anything… Free market my ass :D Sorry for venting this.

Learn what decades of search history can teach us about adapting to the next big shift. Historic recurrence is the idea that patterns repeat over time, even if the details differ. In digital marketing , change is the only constant. Over the last 30 years, we&rsquo;ve seen nonstop shifts and transformations in platforms and tactics. Search, social, and mobile have each gone through their own waves of evolution.  But AI represents something bigger &ndash; not just another tactic, but a fundamental shift in how people research, evaluate, and buy products and services. Estimates vary, but Gartner projects that AI-driven search could account for 25% of search volume by the end of 2026. I suspect the true share will be much higher as Google weaves AI deeper into its results. For digital marketers, it can feel like we need a crystal ball to predict what&rsquo;s next.  While we don&rsquo;t have magical foresight, we do have the next best thing: lessons from the past. This article looks back at the early days of search, how user behavior evolved alongside technology, and what those patterns can teach us as we navigate the AI era. The early days: Wild and wonderful queries If you remember the early web &ndash; AltaVista, Lycos, Yahoo, Hotbot &ndash; search was a free-for-all.  People typed in long, rambling queries, sometimes entire sentences, other times just a few random words that &ldquo;felt&rdquo; right. There were no search suggestions, no &ldquo;people also ask,&rdquo; and no autocorrect.  It was a simpler time, often summed up as &ldquo;10 blue links.&rdquo; Searchers had to experiment, refine, and iterate on their own, and the variance in query wording was huge. For marketers, that meant opportunity",

Recent research highlights intriguing paradoxes in consumer attitudes toward AI-driven marketing. Consumers encounter AI-powered marketing interactions frequently, often without realizing it. According to a 2022 Pew Research Center survey, 27% of Americans reported interacting with AI at least several times a day, while another 28% said they interact with AI about once a day or several times a week (Pew Research Center, 2023). As AI adoption continues to expand across industries, marketing applications &ndash; from personalized recommendations to chatbots &ndash; are increasingly shaping consumer experiences. According to McKinsey & Company (2023), AI-powered personalization can deliver five to eight times the ROI on marketing spend and significantly boost customer engagement. In this rapidly evolving landscape, trust in AI has become a crucial factor for successful adoption and long-term engagement. The World Economic Forum under&shy;scores that &ldquo;trust is the foundation for AI&rsquo;s widespread acceptance,&rdquo; and emphasizes the necessity for companies to adopt self-governance frameworks that prioritize transparency, accountability, and fairness (World Economic Forum, 2025). The Psychology Of AI Trust Consumer trust in AI marketing systems operates fundamentally differently from traditional marketing trust mechanisms. Where traditional marketing trust builds through brand familiarity and consistent experiences, AI trust involves additional psychological dimen",

News Perplexity is rolling out a game-changing move for the AI era: it’s offering publishers a cut of the revenue from AI-powered searches via its new Comet Plus subscription service. They've earmarked a $42.5 million pool, and publishers get a whopping 80% of revenues , while Perplexity retains just 20%. Why it matters: This is one of the first real attempts at fair AI–publisher cooperation—paying not just for licensing, but based on actual usage of their content in AI responses. It’s a direct counter to the “Google Zero” problem, where AI summaries steal traffic and value without compensating creators. Plus, it comes amid mounting legal pressure—Perplexity just lost a court bid in a News Corp lawsuit, pushing them toward solutions like this. This could be a turning point for how AI services and journalism coexist. Thoughts on whether this model is sustainable or if it will spark broader industry shifts? Read more Share",

Learn the signs it’s on track – and the signals it’s steering performance wrong. Smart Bidding ,  Performance Max , and  responsive search ads  (RSAs) can all deliver efficiency, but only if they&rsquo;re optimizing for the right signals. The issue isn&rsquo;t that automation makes mistakes. It&rsquo;s that those mistakes compound over time. Left unchecked, that drift can quietly inflate your CPAs, waste spend, or flood your pipeline with junk leads. Automation isn&rsquo;t the enemy, though. The real challenge is knowing when it&rsquo;s helping and when it&rsquo;s hurting your campaigns. Here&rsquo;s how to tell. When automation is actually failing These are cases where automation isn&rsquo;t just constrained by your inputs. It&rsquo;s actively pushing performance in the wrong direction. Performance Max cannibalization The issue PMax often prioritizes cheap, easy traffic &ndash; especially branded queries or high-intent searches you intended to capture with Search campaigns.  Even with brand exclusions, Google still serves impressions against brand queries, inflating reported performance and giving the illusion of efficiency.  On top of that, when PMax and Search campaigns overlap, Google&rsquo;s auction rules give PMax priority, meaning carefully built Search campaigns can lose impressions they should own. A clear sign this is happening: if you see Search Lost IS (rank) rising in your Search campaigns while PMax spend increases, it&rsquo;s likely PMax is siphoning traffic. Recommendation Use brand exclusions and negatives in PMax to block queries you want Search to own.  Segment brand and non-brand campaigns so you can track each cleanly. And to monitor branded traffic specifically, tools ",

Download the Free Templates Updated: 08/26/25 A few years ago, I was in charge of presenting a big marketing strategy deck to a senior executive. My team and I prepared a script that went something like this: “In Q3, we’ll deliver a unified editorial calendar. Subject matter will reinforce key audience pain points. We will increase paid media investments to leverage this series in integrated campaigns.” It sounded so impressive in my head, but the executive just wanted clarity. She asked, “So, what is it exactly? A blog series we promote in paid?” Oops. In that moment, I realized the words I was using were all wrong. I wasn’t just doing this in meetings. I was adopting this voice in all the brand’s content I was creating, too. I call that jargon-filled approach “content voice.” And since that meeting, I’ve been on a mission to stop its spread — both in my work and at other brands. Let’s break down exactly what content voice means and how to avoid it, along with some real examples of brands that get it right. Table of Contents What is content voice?

Retail media networks are projected to be worth $179.5 billion by 2025 , but capturing share and achieving long-term success won&rsquo;t hinge solely on growing their customer base. With over 200 retail media networks now competing for advertiser attention, the landscape has become increasingly complex and crowded. The RMNs that stand out will be those taking a differentiated approach to meeting the evolving needs of advertisers. The industry&rsquo;s concentration creates interesting dynamics. While some platforms have achieved significant scale, nearly 70% of RMN buyers cite &ldquo;complexity in the buying process&rdquo; as their biggest obstacle. That tension, between explosive growth and operational complexity, is forcing the industry to evolve beyond traditional approaches. As the landscape matures, which strategies will define the next wave of growth: global expansion, hyperlocal targeting, or both? The evolution of retail media platforms To understand where the industry is heading, it&rsquo;s worth examining how successful platforms are addressing advertisers&rsquo; core challenges. Lack of measurement standards across platforms continues to frustrate advertisers who want to compare performance across networks. Manual processes dominate smaller networks , making campaign management inefficient and time-consuming. At the same time, most retailers lack the digital footprint necessary for standalone success. This has created opportunities for platforms that can solve multiple problems simultaneously: standardization, automation, and scale. DoorDash represents an interesting case study in this evolution.

Members Online • SocialNoel Stumbled Upon HealthGEO Just checked out Real Chemistry’s new HealthGEO tool and wow, as someone working in healthcare marketing, this feels like the future. Here’s the gist: HealthGEO uses healthcare-optimized AI to show how platforms like ChatGPT and Gemini really describe your brand, therapies, and science—warts and all. It goes way beyond regular SEO. With HealthGEO, you get: A dashboard mapping your company’s digital reputation across leading AI models Early alerts for weird hallucinations, outdated info, or negative tone Direct benchmarks versus competitors in your space Actionable advice to fix gaps, improve messaging, and build trust Why does this matter? Patients and HCPs now search using AI, not just Google, and that can lead to major misinformation risks. HealthGEO is built to help brands spot issues fast and keep their communication transparent and accurate. In my view, this is essential tech if you want to build a patient-first brand as digital search evolves. Anyone else excited to try this kind of tool, or already doing AI reputation checks for healthcare brands? Would love to swap ideas! Read more Share",

A few months old website so metrics are a bit rough but improving. We have quality blogs in the pipe, so that will hopefully increase the metrics on its own with time but we are now trying to buy some Fiverr gigs to help increase this for us. As I've understood it if we do too much backlink work in too short of a timespan google sees it as a red flag. What does this mean exactly, and where is the limit? How much is too much. And what work would you do if you were us. Some are offering guest posts on sites with DR 20-50, some are offering 100-400 white hat links for instance. Can we do both? How many guest posts can we do, what is too much? How many white hat links (whatever that means) can we do without geting penalized. We want to do as much as possible in as little time as possible. Below is our current stats according to moz: Moz Domain Authority 5 Moz Page Authority 19 Semrush Authority Score 9 Total Backlinks 31 Quality Backlinks 5 % Quality Backlinks 16% DoFollow Backlinks 20% NoFollow Backlinks 80%",

Comet AI Browser Vulnerability Brave described a vulnerability that can be activated when a user asks the Comet AI browser to summarize a web page. The LLM will read the web page, including any embedded prompts that command the LLM to take action on any open tabs According to Brave: &ldquo;The vulnerability we&rsquo;re discussing in this post lies in how Comet processes webpage content: when users ask it to &ldquo;Summarize this webpage,&rdquo; Comet feeds a part of the webpage directly to its LLM without distinguishing between the user&rsquo;s instructions and untrusted content from the webpage. This allows attackers to embed indirect prompt injection payloads that the AI will execute as commands. For instance, an attacker could gain access to a user&rsquo;s emails from a prepared piece of text in a page in another tab.&rdquo; A post on Simon Willison&rsquo;s Weblog shared that Perplexity tried to patch the vulnerability but the fix does not work. A developer posted the following on X: &ldquo;Why is no one talking about this? This is why I don&rsquo;t use an AI browser You can literally get prompt injected and your bank account drained by doomscrolling on reddit:&rdquo; Things aren&rsquo;t looking good for Comet Browser at this time.

Taking a step further to resolve day to day and timely performance degradation of our campaigns, last month we introduced a heavy infusion of AI based creation/analysis and optimization into our performance marketing campaigns for different different key aspects of our campaigns Frequent problem statements that we heard from our clients in the past 1.) Sudden downfall of performance campaigns after a great start 2.) Very high CPC's for google search 3.) High competition and lower ad spends for our clients 4.) Very high CPM's on FB ads 5.) Non consistent daily/weekly performance 6.) Lower ROI's From an Industry point of view - forecasting(predictive analysis) communication customization(more like a personalized or need based) testing(a/b testing of key communications and landing pages) behaviour analysis(more from a audience personna deep dive for targeting) and new content creation (for AMS & Website) From media buying point of view 1.)

Support I’ll keep it very short: I’ve got a really nice digital product. Everyone who tested it loves it. MVP is running and the whole technical side is complete. Now the marketing starts. For me this is the hardest part as I’m a maker, not a marketeer. I’ve got €600 left. So I thought Facebook ads. But my target demographic is 200.000.000 according to Facebook. So with €600 I won’t get far. It’s probably not enough for Facebook to get the algorithm running and see which people are most likely to buy my product. I tried contacting influencers. But they also all want money up front. (Just being a 40% affiliate is not enough for them). And paying €150 for 2 stories on a micro influencer page seems ridiculous to me. I’m willing to give part of the company to an investor, but only like 20%-30% max. But getting investors online is also very expensive. Those dedicated websites all cost like €2k a month. Does anyone of you have an idea to continue? Edit: it’s B2C and it’s in the pet industry (Dogs) Read more Share",

Others draw goatees on their chins to mimic his distinct look. Spotify honors these and other rituals of diehard fans in the latest chapter of its “Fan Life” campaign, which debuted in April . For this installment, the streamer is expanding upon the vivid photography of the original ads with films that dive into the real-life fandoms of Pitbull, Bad Bunny, Charli XCX, Lil Uzi Vert, Rezz, Sleep Token, and Megan Moroney. Every fan has different ways of showing their dedication. The Pitbull ad, for example, shows a group of concertgoers on a bus, carefully putting the finishing touches on their matching uniforms. In another spot, a young Bad Bunny fan delicately twirls his abuela as they dance together in a crowded kitchen, as others look on and applaud.  Meanwhile, a couple of Charli XCX devotees ride a bike through a neighborhood after an extremely late night out. They’re laughing hysterically, with one holding a handful of pink balloons.   The ads, created by Spotify&#8217;s in-house team, will appear on social, billboards, and subway stations in the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Colombia. Other spots depict crowds wearing Rezz’s trademark HypnoGoggles; young women belting out lyrics to Megan Maroney&#8217;s &#8220;Tennessee Orange;&#8221; and Young Sleep Token fans spray-painting lawn flamingos black in honor of the mysterious English metal band.  “Fan Life” will also spotlight the fans of local artists revered by regional audiences, including Aitana (Spain), La Mano 1.9 (France), Nina Chuba (Germany), Sabino (Mexico), Pabllo Vittar (Brazil), and PinkPantheress (",

Will Cain 8 Months After His Show Launch  'I have a vision of what I want the show to be, and I think we're continuing to evolve it into that vision,' Cain said.   Will Cain in the studio of his 4 p.m. ET show Courtesy of Fox News By Mark Mwachiro --> Will Cain may still be the new kid on the block when it comes to his show’s inclusion in the Fox News weekday schedule, but his show’s performance since its January launch has him feeling like a veteran. The Will Cain Show has averaged 2.3 million viewers and 275,000 in the Adults 25-54 demo since it debuted on Jan. 21. The 4 p.m. ET show has also grown the timeslot with a +42% jump in total viewers and +53% rise in the demo compared to the same hour in 2024. When TVNewser first caught up with Cain in January , he approached building the show from a vantage of “being open-minded, honest about your opinion, hearing rebuttal, weighing the facts, and seeking the truth.” Now, hosting from the confines of his recently unveiled studio in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex , a nearly settled Cain has sought to establish his show as one that focuses “on stories that are not getting enough attention in the news and not doing the same stories that have been done by other programs all throughout the day.” Cain was gracious enough to sit through another edition of TVNewser’s “5 Questions For…” series as we checked in to see how things are moving along in the 4 p.m. ET hour since the show’s January debut. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Eight months in. How&#8217;s it going on the Will Cain show? It&#8217;s going really well. I think there are two different ways to judge a show. One is the outward metrics, ratings, and definitions of success that include the opinions of the people who matter inside your organization, and that&#8217;s been an overwhelming and great success. I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased with being the highest-rated show in daytime on Fox and blowing away the comp",

Aflac By Jason Notte --> The Women’s National Basketball Players Association opted out of the WNBA&#8217;s current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) last October, seeking greater salary incentives and benefits, especially as league viewership and attendance continue to grow.  Now, with the CBA set to expire on Oct. 31, a potential work stoppage is on the horizon for 2026 if an agreement isn’t reached. As the WNBA postseason approaches and the CBA deadline looms, players believe they have a right to a greater share of league revenue from sources including sponsorships. With no animosity toward the league, brands and their observers tend to agree—as do the numbers. The data doesn’t lie Wasserman’s women-focused practice, The Collective, released a report in 2023 that noted that athletes in men’s sports earn 21 times more salary than women playing those same sports. As a result, women in sports rely on brands and sponsorship for 82% of their income (compared to just 37% for men) while their salary comprises just 18% of their total compensation (67% for men). “The reason that they’re prolific on social media is because they have to be … that’s where they build their audiences. That’s where they build their brand. That’s where they get their money. So as a result, they’re good at it,” Elizabeth Lindsey, Wasserman’s global president of brands and properties, said during a panel in Nike Global Headquarters in Oregon in July.

Members Online • Ketul-Sindhwad Yesterday we discussed AI Agents — here’s what I’ve learned (and the next big question) Discussion Yesterday I posted about AI Agents as the “employees” of the future, and the responses were amazing. Some of you shared how you’re already testing agents in marketing, automation, and even customer support. Others raised valid concerns about reliability, cost, and control. After going through the comments, I realized one key takeaway: ➡️ The real power of AI Agents isn’t just in replacing one task, but in orchestrating multiple tasks together like a mini digital workforce. That got me thinking about the next step: Instead of single-task agents, what happens when we have multi-agent systems working together? Could we see companies running like “digital organizations” where agents act as a content team, marketing team, and ops team — all coordinating automatically? And if that happens… what roles do humans play? Strategy only? Creativity? Oversight? I’d love to keep the discussion going: 👉 Do you think multi-agent collaboration is realistic in the next 2–3 years, or is this still a long-term dream? 👉 What real-world barriers do you see (tech limits, trust, legal issues, etc.)? Looking forward to your thoughts — yesterday’s thread was 🔥 and I’m excited to dive deeper with all of you. Read more Share",

Members Online • Key-Hyena5292 Why don’t we actually use Indian apps when we preach #MadeInIndia? Discussion I’ve noticed something that honestly bugs me. We love to say #MadeInIndia until it comes to actually using Indian apps. The moment an Indian alternative launches, there’s either silence or instant skepticism. Meanwhile, people abroad back their homegrown products effortlessly and with pride. That’s what pushed us to build something new: Vokal India. It’s Aadhaar-verified, secure, and built for Indians. No shady logins, no random data leaks just a platform that puts trust first. We didn’t make this because it was trendy. We made it because we were done waiting for someone else to solve it. Right now, we’re testing it out with a small circle and looking for genuine feedback. So here’s my ask what do you think stops us from supporting Indian tech the way others support theirs? Is it trust? UX? Just habit? I’d love to hear honest takes. Read more Share",

Members Online • Alozaps Major Movement on Bing Help Is anyone seeing a big change with rankings and traffic on Bing in the last 24-48 hours? For me, traffic appears to have completely collapsed. There are no penalties or guidelines issues in Webmaster Tools. A lot of previously high-performing pages (ranking in the top 3) look to have fallen out of the SERPs entirely. Pages can show up if you do a site search, but they're not ranking at all. I'm seeing a lot of random, low-quality SEO sites dominate the top results now. I have always killed it with Bing, ranking at the top of their SERPs for years. I hope this is just a temporary blip and things will go back to normal later. Read more Share",

Performance Max (PMax) advertisers just got a major visibility upgrade: Channel Reporting is now available at the account level, not just within individual campaigns. How it works: View and compare all PMax campaigns in a single reporting overview. Segment by conversion metrics to understand what&rsquo;s driving results. Identify performance patterns across channels without jumping campaign to campaign. Why we care. Until now, channel performance data was siloed within each PMax campaign. The new account-level reporting makes it easier to spot trends, compare results, and optimize across campaigns. The big picture. Google notes that channel data is available for PMax campaigns &ldquo;at this time&rdquo; &mdash; a phrasing that suggests the feature could expand to other campaign types down the road. Bottom line. More visibility, less friction. This change gives advertisers a faster, more complete view of PMax performance &mdash; and hints at broader reporting upgrades ahead. First seen.

Members Online • Puzzleheaded_Size447 Lead Magnet Vs. Direct to Booking - Which makes more sense? To give some context I am a franchise broker (think a realtor but for franchise businesses), my broad target demo are people who want to buy a franchise and are currently in the 'investigative stage' where they are ready to make a move in the next 1-3 months if they found 'the right' model. I'm advertising on Meta ($6k/mo ad spend) with a small agency (this guys is definitely good and knows what he is doing in terms of getting on-paper qualified leads through the campaign). Our current ad method is to pick one of the high performing franchises we have, advertise it like the actual brand would, but we don't disclose the name (because if we did they could just go directly to the brand and I would never know/wouldn't get paid). So they have to come to me, and on our call we go through what they're looking for, if the industry is even a fit for them, and then I can schedule a follow up call to go through multiple options that fit as good if not better for what they're looking for. With that said, I am at a little bit of a crossroad with how the marketing is going. As I've talked with these leads, they tend to be very hesitant coming onto the call since they don't know what franchise we're referencing, and then when they get on they're primarily looking for info on the specific franchise we were advertising for. **Now I'm not ignorant to how actual sales works, and know that you need to be asking good, deeper level motivation questions to be able to sell effectively. This is a skillset I'm actively developing** With this said, I'm big into Alex Hormozi's content and am reading his $100M Leads again, and am hung up on his idea of 'lead magnet' to either uncover a problem they didn't know they had, or solves one step in a multistep process to encourage them to then book a call after providing a good amount of value. This is especially true for high ticket items like what I do. With our current ad method, we are doing the 'direct offer/book call' instead of providing any value up front to build trust and rapport with the lead before they book the call. I really see where Alex is coming from to get higher quality engaged leads with his 'value/lead magnet' first, then show them how its hard, then finally offer them to book a call. With the current lead production, it seems like I'll just have to become a dog of a sales person (not with 'tricks' but with actual skill) which I can imagine is going to take years of reps to harness. I guess my question comes down to this- Do I just take on that task of becoming this elite level sales guy and figure it out? Or try to build a more 'Hormozi' style ad campaign where peop",

Members Online • wilecoyote42 Start work on a website when we'll have to change domains in a few months... yes or no? Help I maintain a travel booking website that is a few years old and doesn't have much SEO juice right now (though it does have some). My client wants to give it a big SEO push, and is asking me for a plan and budget to start creating new content for the site. The problem: the client tried to register the current domain for the website as a trademark, and it got denied by my country's trademark office for being too generic. We came up with a new name and submitted it, and we think it has reasonable chances of being approved, but it will take the trademark office at least 3-6 months (counting from now), or perhaps even more. My idea has always been that, as soon as the trademark office approves the new name, I'll clone the current website in the new domain and add redirects in the existing domain, but I don't know whether it's worth it to start creating content now in the existing website in the old domain, when we'll have to migrate anyway in a few months. However, my client is in a rush and wants me to start ASAP. What would be maximum \"waiting period\" when it's still worth it to start working on the current site now? What I mean is: if I knew that we could start using the new domain in a month, obviously I would wait, and if I knew for sure that the trademark office was going to take another year (!), then I'd start working now in the current domain. But what about the possible ranges \"in the middle\"? Read more Share",

But, I often get requests from clients who need creatives too. Now, they usually don't have a creative team or extra money to invest in creatives. That's why I made this tool. It took my more than a week to get it work perfectly. Currently, only I can access and create them for you. But, if gets reach, I might offer my services and share my tool to small agencies and freelancers. My tool is called Bulsai(Bulk static AI )ads tool.

I see so many bootcamps and certifications out there, but I’m not sure which ones actually help with real placements. For people already in the field, how did you get your start? Did you rely on free resources, or did you go for a structured program that taught SEO, Google Ads, analytics, etc.?

Members Online • Ketul-Sindhwad What exactly are AI Agents and how are they shaping the future of business & marketing? Discussion Hey everyone, Lately, I’ve been diving deep into the concept of AI Agents and I feel like this space is going to explode in the next few years. From what I understand, AI Agents are basically autonomous programs powered by AI models (like GPTs) that can reason, plan, and take actions on their own to achieve a specific goal. Unlike a regular chatbot that just answers queries, these agents can: • Gather data from different sources • Make decisions based on logic + past inputs • Trigger actions like sending emails, scraping data, or updating CRMs • Even collaborate with other AI agents for complex workflows In marketing & business automation, I’m already seeing use cases like: • Automating SEO tasks (keyword research, content briefs, backlink outreach) • Running personalized ad campaigns with zero human touch • Handling customer support with multi-step reasoning • Managing sales pipelines end-to-end It feels like we’re moving from “AI as an assistant” → to “AI as an employee.” 🔹 Do you think AI Agents will replace traditional SaaS tools in the near future? 🔹 Anyone here experimenting with them in real projects (marketing, e-commerce, ops)? 🔹 Which frameworks/platforms are you using (Auto-GPT, CrewAI, LangChain, etc.)? Would love to hear your thoughts and real-world experiences. Read more Share",

    "essence": "Search Engine Land » SEO » Article Why community is the antidote to AI overload in search marketing Published: August 25, 2025 at 9:00 am Read Time: 7 minutes Share Written by Ashley Liddell Table of Contents Table of Contents In a world where AI-generated answers sound the same, community-driven trust gives brands individuality, credibility, and lasting preference. In 2025, people aren&rsquo;t just searching for answers anymore. They&rsquo;re looking for genuine responses from the people they trust most:  Creators. Communities. Fellow brand supporters.  In many ways, community has become an algorithm of its own. AI-powered tools like Google Gemini , ChatGPT , and Perplexity have made knowledge more accessible than ever.  But in doing so, they&rsquo;ve also flattened it.  Answers feel repetitive, citations pull from the same limited sources, and brand voices risk becoming interchangeable. That&rsquo;s where community comes in.  While generative AI commoditizes information, community restores individuality.  It offers what no model can compress into tokens:  Authentic connection. Lived experience. Trust. When democratized information becomes homogenized I can still remember when Google &ndash; and later YouTube &ndash; made information feel democratized, putting knowledge at our fingertips like never before. But with the rise of AI, that same accessibility now comes at a cost: everything starts to sound the same. Every brand competing for similar keywords risks becoming interchangeable, sounding the same in AI-generated summaries that deliver information without distinction.  Meanwhile, authority is concentrated into a small set of repeatedly cited sources, so users encounter little variation in what LLMs surface. In some ways, this is similar to traditional SEO .  But there&rsquo;s an important difference: websites once gave us the chance to &ldquo;get our brand over&rdquo; and show what made our solution unique.  That&rsquo;s what feels lost in an AI-driven search ",

In the lawsuit, she alleged that KMOV triggered anxiety and depression and harmed her job prospects and that Danahey was demoted through schedule changes under a new news director hired in 2016. Danahey worked at KMOV for about six years starting in 2014 until being fired in 2020. She originally sued both the station’s news director Scott Diener as well as KMOV’s then-parent company, Meredith Corporation. The suit was later split in two. She lost the case against Diener when the jury ruled unanimously for Diener in April.

Menachem Ani August 25, 2025 &#8901; 12 min read Menachem Ani Founder & CEO at JXT Group Bio Follow 510 READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Many agencies and marketers believe that success in paid media is primarily down to the quality of your ads or the specificity of your landing pages. While those elements are important, they&rsquo;re meaningless unless they sit on a foundation of alignment with client needs. The cleanest account structure and flawless creatives may hit every platform benchmark, but any success will be short-lived if you&rsquo;re not clued into what&rsquo;s actually important to your clients. Higher revenues, more profit, better lead quality, shorter sales cycles &ndash; this is what typically matters to the people paying the bills. At JXT Group, we make sure that the foundation is laid before building a single campaign by gathering a clear picture of how our clients make money, who their ideal customers are, and what a proper conversion looks like. Here are the five phases we use to engineer that experience. 1. Understand The Business Model Financially, most Google Ads clients can be split into one of two business models: those that sell products at face value and those that want leads who convert at a later date, typically through an offline interaction. Verticals like ecommerce and info products sell their goods (physical or otherwise) at face value, allowing you to see revenue figures inside of Google Ads. Verticals like local services and SaaS rely on capturing interest in the form of phone calls, form fills, and chat sessions. These leads may or may not turn into actual sales later. Anyone dealing with physical products also has to factor cash flow, procurement costs, shipping fees, and return rates into bo",

    "essence": "Data & Insights Marketing and Advertising Internships Are on the Decline The downward trend parallels a decrease in young people employed in the industry overall The reason isn't always a lack of opportunity. deagreez/Adobe Stock By Paul Hiebert --> Many careers in marketing and advertising begin with an internship. At a time when the share of young people working in the industry is decreasing , it should come as no surprise that internships are also disappearing. Figures from employment data provider Live Data Technologies show a year-over-year decline in internships at U.S. marketing and advertising companies since 2022. In addition to the overall decline, the seasonal spike in internships during the summer has also become less pronounced in recent years. In 2022, the number of interns in June was nearly 125% higher than those in January of that same year. This year, however, marketing and advertising internships in June were up only 40% compared to the beginning of 2025. To arrive at these findings, Live Data Technologies examined publicly available information from several U.S. marketing and advertising companies. The list includes ad giants IPG and Omnicom, along with Publicis agencies Digitas and Starcom. Internships at marketing and advertising agencies appear to be dropping for a few reasons. One is companies’ increasing push to diminish labor costs through layoffs , consolidation , and artificial intelligence . Because of that, companies are less likely to invest in early-career employees, according to analysts. “The continued infusion of AI and automation has led to a decline in entry-level roles for many organizations, with hiring priority shifting to mid- and senior-level positions,” said Justin Roberts, associate vice president of global culture and inclusion at independent media agency Kepler. Additional numbers from Live Data Technologies illustrate this shift. Staff positions at U.S. marketing and advertising firms have diminished nearly 11% since January 2022. Manager and director jobs, meanwhile, have remained relatively steady during the same period. “The entry-level crunch has a trickle-down effect,” said J. Scott Hamilton, president and CEO of Live Data Technologies. “With no junior roles to fill next year, there will be fewer internships this year.” In addition to a decline in available roles, there’s less demand for the types of internships many agencies offer—particularly unpaid ones. Laura Emanuel, managing director at Red Thread PR, said applicants used to clamor for the agency’s unpaid internship. She remembers working with a group of three or four interns each season. Deciding who to pick from a pool of candidates was difficult. “Ten years ago, we would promote our internships with a single social post and be inundated with eager, ambitious college students pitching themselves for the role,” Emanuel said. “It was a truly competitive search.” That’s no longer the case. Now, the public relations agency looks to bring in ",

Question I’m currently on my second product launch, and my first attempt at marketing didn’t go the way I hoped. It wasn’t a total failure, but it taught me some lessons I’m applying this time around. From my first launch, I learned that running ads before validating the product is a mistake. It’s tempting to think ads will solve traction, but without product-market fit, they just burn cash. The second lesson was that relying only on word-of-mouth isn’t enough. Early users talked, but growth stalled fast. Now, I’m balancing organic channels with small, targeted experiments instead of going all-in on one approach. I’d love to hear from others , what’s been your biggest marketing mistake, and how do you approach marketing effectively without overspending or overcomplicating? Read more Share",

Many organizations see AI as the definitive means of achieving this efficiency. The reality is that AI is no longer a speculative investment. It has emerged as a strategic enabler to unify data, align siloed teams, and adapt to complex buyer behaviors in real time. According to an SAP study, 48% of executives use generative AI tools daily, while 15% use AI multiple times per day. The opportunity for modern Go-to-Market (GTM) leaders is not just to accelerate legacy tactics with AI, but to reimagine the architecture of their GTM strategy altogether. This shift represents an inflection point. AI has the potential to power seamless and adaptive GTM systems: measurable, scalable, and deeply aligned with buyer needs. In this article, I will share a practical framework to modernize B2B GTM using AI, from aligning internal teams and architecting modular workflows to measuring what truly drives revenue. The Role Of AI In Modern GTM Strategies For GTM leaders and practitioners, AI represents an opportunity to achieve efficiency without compromising performance. Many organizations leverage new technology to automate repetitive, time-intensive tasks, such as prospect scoring and routing, sales forecasting, content personalization, and account prioritization. But its true impact lies in transforming how GTM systems operate: consolidating data, coordinating actions, extracting insights, a",

    "essence": "Sports Marketing News ESPN Bet Wagers on Football Fans and App in New Ads The sports brand's wagering arm shows off new features ahead of the 2025 NFL and college seasons and links up with the new streamer A fantasy football player gets a personalized trip through ESPN Bet's FanCenter in the Sportsbook's new ad. ESPN BET By Jason Notte --> ESPN is making significant changes ahead of the 2025 college and NFL football seasons, and its new campaign from ESPN Bet Sportsbook is guiding fans through the tunnel, connecting games, gaming, and content. Today, ESPN Bet is launching its “Sportsbook for Sports Fans” marketing push, with new ads showing fans navigating data and bets from the couch, changing up their fantasy football roster at the bar, and making parlay bets in a laundromat with picks from ESPN personalities—including ad narrator and ESPN First Take host and executive producer Stephen A. Smith. Developed with help from creative agency Prophet, the spots showcase the sportsbook’s recently introduced FanCenter, which personalizes offerings based on wagering history, ESPN app favorites, and players on their fantasy rosters. The ads also highlight updating player stat cards and game logs, as well as featured bets from Smith and First Take, host Mike Greenberg and his Get Up show, ESPN Bet Live, and other programming. In a nod to one of ESPN’s biggest recent moves, the campaigns show bet-tracking features that allow fans to follow their bets on screen while watching games on the recently launched ESPN streaming app. As ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro told The Athletic during the app’s launch earlier this week, “it is the first inning” of the company’s digital and streaming innovations and integrations. Disney Reveals Marketing Game Plan for Its ESPN Streaming App “There are millions of people who use ESPN to get their stats, their stories about their favorite players, and the biggest fantasy sports product in the world,” said Gadi Rouache, head of design and creative at PENN Interactive. “What we’re creating is a seamless experience to connect sports fans to sports betting in a way that is intuitive and at your fingertips.” In the first ad, “Tools,” ESPN Bet argues that it’s streamlining the game day experience by showing a fan doing fantasy football research in front of multiple monitors before eventually grabbing a smartphone and using the sportsbook to browse stats. In the same ad, another fan watching an ESPN studio show opens the sportsbook app to find bets related to what’s being discussed on screen. The second, “Game Time,” features a fan using ESPN’s DTC service to browse live betting markets, place a bet on ESPN Bet, and track the wager from her couch. The scene then cuts to two fans at a bar pulling up FanCenter and doubling down on their fantasy football matchup with an additional bet. “When we first floated the idea of the laundromat, we had some colleagues that looked at us quizzically, but we were saying that, for sports fans—and that is ",

Some say high-quality backlinks are still king, while others argue that content quality and relevance now outweigh link building. What’s your experience?

Members Online • philbilly86 Unsure of what to do in my current in-house position (SEO/Search related). Question I work in-house as an SEO/Content manager selling used cars and automotive accessories. My team publishes regular blog content around car buying, ownership, financing, modification, customisation and maintenance. We’ve built structured content clusters, and most of the work follows a conservative, factual approach. The problem is that our visibility in Google seems stuck. Impressions often climb but clicks trend down. Content ranks initially, then either flattens or drops. When we refresh and optimise, results stay static or fall further. Case and point - our traffic is down 10% WoW, and keywords that have lost the most traffic are branded keywords (products we don't sell). Other keywords that have lost clicks have grown in impressions, maintained rankings but had the ass fall out of them in terms of clicks. Now my teams wants to go back and 'optimise' content they worked on less that 3 weeks ago. Our team is very much aware of the role that social search and video search plays in populating the search, but I'm struggling to figure out what I can do to help our existing content rank higher, given what I can control and influence. Off-site content and backlinks sit outside my control. I’d like to create stronger assets like comparison tables, visuals, or videos, but I don’t have extra resources. Development support is another bottleneck. I'm trying hard to work on tracking secondary metrics such as product page views from SEO content, but marketing intelligence resources aren't there for now. Right now 99.9% of traffic comes from Google search. Less than 0.005% came from LLMs or AI tools last month. At this stage I don’t see how I can meaningfully optimise for LLMs without bigger resources, and I suspect strong SEO practices already align well with AI discovery. So here’s where I’m stuck: How do I break out of this flatline without more budget for advanced content formats? Are there approaches you’ve seen succeed when you can’t influence backlinks? Any ideas on making existing clusters perform better instead of just producing more? With tracking blocked by limited dev capacity, how do you make a business case for more investment? Really struggling here and would appreciate any input from people that have navigated these seas in the past. Read more Share",

Question Having been working with marketing automation for many years, I’m not questioning its importance; we all see how central it has become. What I’m curious about is the value of being certified in it. If someone offered you a chance to get certified in marketing automation, what would make you not want to do it? Do you feel like the industry doesn’t really value certifications? Is it more about cost and time than content? Or do you prefer just learning hands-on with the tools you already use? I’m asking because I’m working on something in this space and don’t want to assume. I want to understand the real objections, hesitations, or “meh, not for me” reasons. Would love to hear your honest take. And if you’ve done any automation certs before, what actually made it worthwhile for you? (Or not?) Read more Share",

Question I thought I saw a similar story on here and wanted to share mine: So I’ve been working for a while now; doing my best in managing multiple Reddit accounts, running campaigns, and keeping things active with some community friendly strategies. I love to focus on organic reach and making sure posts actually perform. On average the campaigns I’ve done usually get around 40K to 100K+ views. But here’s the thing... I was only being paid pennies each week. Sometimes I’d be working basically full time hours; posting, monitoring, maintaining quality, all that. And you know what? It never really hit me how draining it was until I vented to a friend who told me I might be underselling myself. Now I’m kinda questioning everything. Should I stick with Reddit marketing and just look for better clients, or should I switch niches completely...like TikTok or Instagram marketing? Honestly I’d rather stick with Reddit since that’s where I’ve built the most experience, but I feel like I need to make a change... I'd love some advice from people who are in this space. Also if anyone knows of better opportunities or directions I could take I’d definitely be open to hearing them, please! Read more Share",

Discussion This might sound a little paranoid, but I’ve been running test prompts in ChatGPT, Claude, and even Perplexity, and I swear some brands are showing up way more often than they should. Even when I ask super broad or neutral questions like “best CRM tools” or “customer retention tools,” the same names keep popping up. Meanwhile, my company with decent SEO and solid content... nothing. It’s like we don’t exist to these models. I get how SEO works, but this feels like something totally different. Are we supposed to be optimizing for AI models now too? Is generative engine optimization an actual strategy? And are there tools that even tell you how your brand shows up in these AI answers? I’ve searched tools to improve online visibility, but none that actually help you understand how language models like ChatGPT or Claude are ranking or surfacing brands. I feel like something big is shifting and barely anyone’s talking about it yet. If anyone’s already working on this, I’d love to hear what you’re seeing. Read more Share",

Members Online • Available-Swimmer-28 Should I stick with Copywriting or go “All-in”? Ladies and gentlemen, earlier this month I lost two jobs in just two days. One was an in-person role as a content writer at my city’s municipal government, and the other was a remote SEO assistant position for an affiliate site in the betting industry. Since then, I’ve been applying for new jobs, and honestly, I don’t see AI as the real threat. The real villain is the in-person model. Around 90% of openings demand it, and convincing employers that I can deliver the same results from home has been tough. I’m married, my wife is eight months pregnant, we rent our place—so no job means nothing coming in. I’ve got a solid portfolio, so that’s not the issue. At this point, I see two paths: keep pushing for another copywriting role (I even paid for LinkedIn Premium to improve my chances), or launch a new project from scratch. What’s this project? I live in a coastal capital city in Brazil, and I realized most local hotels barely use social media or even Google My Business (believe it or not). My idea is to hire a filmmaker and a designer by the day, then go prospecting hotels and offering communication packages (silver and gold). Signing these hotels would bring in quick income (as soon as the contract is closed), while giving me the structure to keep producing material and possibly renewing contracts or expanding to more clients. So yeah, I’m stuck. It’s been 24 days without a job, and I keep wondering if this strategy of starting from zero could actually work. What would you recommend? Read more Share",

Members Online • slrhvy Solving this Verizon X/Twitter Ad - help needed. Okay so, I'm running Video Ads on X/Twitter and having an issue where the in app browser loads the content underneath the ad. This only occurs on mobile, and only for Video Ads. Image Ads will instantly redirect to the destination. I tried everything under the sun and almost gave up until...I found THIS Verizon Ad that immediatly redirects outside of X, to their destination (the verizon website) this is the only Ad I've came across that has this function, and Ad Support refuses to answer why I can't reverse engineer this or replicate the result. I need some expert ideas, I've tried deeplinks,smartlinks, nothing beats the in app browser opening the destination underneath the ad on mobile. Anyone have a solution for this? You'll have to DM me for the Verizon Ad link to see it open on mobile yourself. I can also send over a direct link to one of my Ads which will not open directly even in the same format as the Verizon Ad. Thanks for any help on this! Read more Share",

They’ve got this Latino family talking about how “mi casa” smells—basically playing off the whole “Latinos love Fabuloso lavender” thing. It’s not offensive or anything, just super on-the-nose. Honestly felt more cheesy than clever, like they were trying too hard and it came off kinda ridiculous. Read more Share",

Members Online • Material-Escape1057 AI is my design intern now (and it’s better than any ad campaign I ran) News I used to think marketing meant running ads. I spent way too much time fiddling with ad settings, convinced that if I just nailed the targeting, sales would show up. Spoiler: they didn’t. Turns out the ads weren’t the issue, my products just sucked. So I flipped it. Instead of throwing money at ads after launch, I started putting in the work before I even hit publish. AI basically became my design intern. I’d check out what was already moving on Etsy, drop those ideas into AI, and spin out new versions that leaned on proven demand but still looked original. Here’s how I make it work: Prompts. If you type “the image features…” in MidJourney, you’ll get cluttered backgrounds every time. Switching it to “the vector t-shirt design of…” and adding “white background” gives me a clean, usable result without hours of cleanup. Tools. MidJourney handles the art, but it’s terrible with text. I run the lettering through Ideogram instead so it looks professional. Then I shrink the files in Illustrator, otherwise uploads drag forever. Results. That little setup has brought me more sales than any ad campaign I ran. I’m not chasing clicks anymore, just listing products people are already searching for. Anyone else here using AI this way? What’s your go to trick? Read more Share",

Members Online • MobilityTweezer Growing an established event Question Anyone have experience with companies like McCabe Group, Frame House, or AC Entertainment? These types of marketing companies would promote music events, festivals, etc. I work for a mid sized music festival that I feel is ready for whatever the next step is. We’re unsure what the next step is. Presently, marketing is Facebook heavy, insta, X, magazine ads(seems like a dead end), YouTube, visitors bureaus, some direct mail, partnerships with other venues (giveaways),billboards, some radio etc. and lots of free tickets to fund raiser events(local). It’s all done in house. Everything we do feels like guesses with not enough trackable data and decisions based on that. Word of mouth is our strong suit. The festival has been around for decades. Our marketing budget is small compared to big festivals, but for contemplations sake, let’s say it’s $50,000, which might not be enough for much I do realize. Any general advice about which way to steer this very established ship? If we never promoted it again it would probably be fine, just no real growth. I’m traveling right now, so I might not reply to any responses I may get, but I promise I’ll try. Thank you in advance. Read more Share",

I just saw one on Facebook — it was a brand I've never heard of promoting a product I’d never buy. I'm not the brand’s target audience, and that brand is missing out by not understanding who to market their product towards. No company can market to everyone — so who are you selling to? That's the question that your target audience answers. Good targeting speaks directly to a specific group, making viewers feel connected with the brand. Understanding target audiences is key to any successful marketing strategy. Every product and service has a target audience, no matter how niche. In this article, I'll walk you through how to perform a target audience analysis for your brand. Table of Contents What is a target audience? Target Market vs Target Audience Types of Target Audiences How to Find Your Target Audience Target Audience Examples What is a target audience? “Target audience” refers to a group of consumers characterized by shared qualities like demographic data, behaviors, interests, etc. Most companies and products will have multiple target audiences representing diverse products and user groups. Brands identify their target consumers by articulating audience features to create a clear picture of who the potential customer is. This image clarifies brand messaging, focuses marketing efforts, and even guides what products to develop next. For example, a wine company can't sell to both high-end wine aficionados and novice wine drinkers. Through target audience research, they could identify their target wine drinkers as those ages 24 to 30 who have an interest in wine but limited budgets. Knowing their audi",

Here’s a smarter framework for growth that avoids platform tunnel vision. Mordy Oberstein August 21, 2025 ⋅ 8 min read Mordy Oberstein Founder at Unify Brand Marketing Bio Follow 1.3K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> This week&rsquo;s Ask An SEO question is about whether small brands should prioritize TikTok over Google to grow their audience: &ldquo;I keep hearing that TikTok is a better platform for small brands with an easier route to an audience. Do you think that Google is still relevant, or should I go all in on TikTok?&rdquo; The short answer to your question is that you do not want to pigeonhole your business into one channel, no matter the size. There&rsquo;s also no such thing as an &ldquo;easier&rdquo; way. They are all hard. I&rsquo;m going to get the obvious out of the way so we can get to something beyond the usual answers to this question. Your brand should be where your audience is. Great, now that we didn&rsquo;t spend four paragraphs saying the same thing that&rsquo;s been said 100 times before, let me tell you something you want to consider beyond &ldquo;be where your audience is.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s Not About Channel, It&rsquo;s About Traction I have a lot of opinions here, so let me just &ldquo;channel&rdquo; my inner Big Lebowski and preface this with ... this is just my opinion, man. Stop thinking about channels. That&rsquo;s way down the funnel (yet marketers make channels the seminal question all the time). Start thinking about traction. How do you generate the most traction? When I say &ldquo;traction,&rdquo; what I really mean is how to start resonating with your audience so that the &ldquo;chatter&rdquo; and momentum about who you are compound so that new doors of opportunity open up. The answer to that question is not, &ldquo;We will focus on TikTok.&rdquo; The answer is also not, &ldquo;We will focus on Google.&rdquo; The answer is also not, &ldquo;We will focus on YouTube.&rdquo; I could go on. Now, there is another side to this: resources and operations. The question is, how do you balance traction with the amount of resources you have? For smaller brands, I would think about: What can you do to gain traction that bigger brands have a hard time with? For example, big brands have a very hard time with video content . They have all sorts of production standards, operations, and a litany of people who have a say, who shouldn&rsquo;t even be in sniffing distance of having a say. They can&rsquo;t simply turn on their phone, record a video, and share something of value. You can. Does that mean you should focus on TikTok? Nope. It means you should think about what you can put out there that would resonate and help your audience, and does that work for the format? If so, you may want to go with video shorts . I&rsquo;m not sure why you would limit",

The research showed that while general solutions stopped threats like SQL injection or cross-site scripting, a dedicated WordPress security solution consistently stopped WordPress-specific exploits at a significantly higher rate. WordPress Vulnerabilities Due to the popularity of the WordPress platform, WordPress plugins and themes are a common focus for hackers, and vulnerabilities can quickly be exploited in the wild. Once proof-of-concept code is public, attackers often act within hours, leaving website owners little time to react. This is why it is critical to be aware of the security provided by a web host and of how effective those solutions are in a WordPress environment. Methodology Patchstack explained their methodology: &ldquo;As a baseline, we have decided to host &ldquo;honeypot&rdquo; sites (sites against which we will perform controlled pentesting with a set of 11 WordPress-specific vulnerabilities) with 5 distinct hosting providers, some of which have ingrained features presuming to help with blocking WordPress vulnerabilities and/or overall security. In addition to the hosting provider&rsquo;s security measures and third-party providers for additional measures like robust WAFs or other patching providers, we have also installed Patchstack on every site, with our test question being: How many of these threats will bypass firewalls and other patching providers to ultimately reach Patchstack? And will Patchstack be able to block them all successfully?&rdquo; Testing process Each website was set up the same way, with identical plugins, versions, and settings. Patchstack used a &ldquo;exploitation testing toolkit&rdquo; to run the same exploit tests in the same order on every site. Results were checked automatically and by hand to see if attacks were stopped, and whether the block came from the host&rsquo;s defenses or from Patchstack. General Overview: Hosting Providers Versus Vulnerabilities The Patchstack case study tested five different configurations of security defenses, plus Patchstack. 1. Hosting Provider A Plus Cloudflare WAF 2. Hosting Provider B + Firewall + Monarx Server and Website Security 3. Hosting Provider C + Firewall + Imunify Web Server Security 4. Hosting Provider D + ConfigServer Firewall 5. Hosting Provider E + Firewall The result of the testing showed that the various hosting infrastructure d",

See where your ads run, review placements, and decide if Search Partners deserve a place in your budget. VIP CONTRIBUTOR Brooke Osmundson August 20, 2025 ⋅ 4 min read VIP CONTRIBUTOR Brooke Osmundson Director of Growth Marketing at Smith Micro Software Bio Follow 1.7K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Google quietly rolled out a change advertisers have wanted for years: site-level reporting for the Search Partner Network. Until now, advertisers could only opt in or out, with little understanding of where their ads actually showed. This update finally gives visibility into where budgets are spent outside of Google. Google lists this as an August 2025 update in its Help Center, however it wasn&rsquo;t announced widespread. Read on to understand the update from Google, how advertisers are reacting, and what you can do with this new level of information. What Changed in Search Partner Reporting? The new reporting applies to Search, Shopping, and App campaigns. You&rsquo;ll now see which partner sites served your ads and how many impressions each one received. Think of it as the kind of placement data we already get in Performance Max, just extended to Search Partners. This update follows other moves Google has made to address long-standing concerns about partner quality. Earlier this year, they introduced brand safety pre-screening options with IAS, DoubleVerify, and Zefr. They also said parked domains will be opted out by default before the end of 2025. This visibility layer feels like the missing piece that makes the rest of those updates more usable. How Are Advertisers Reacting to This Update? The update on Search Partner Network reporting was first found by Anthony Higman, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his opinion. Higman stated: Still Most Likely Wont Be Participating In The Search Partner Network But This Is Unprecedented And What ALL Advertisers Have Been Requesting For Decades! Honestly NEVER Thought I Would See This Day.&rdquo; Others gave some versioning mixture of applauding Google for giving data to advertisers that they&rsquo;ve been asking for for years, while also being somewhat skeptical. Mike Ryan replied to Higman with his thoughts: I mean, good step but also, it&rsquo;s the PMax version: impression data only. Aaron Levy shared his thoughts on LinkedIn , stating that this is a major step in the right direction for Google. Why This Matters & How to Take Action Without Search Partner Network reporting, it was tough to justify opting in. Now advertisers finally have data to audit where ads run, decide if it fits brand standards, and see if partner traffic adds any real value. That said, the update is only as good as the action that advertisers take with the information available. Some sites won&rsquo;t align with brand guidelines. Others may generate c",

    "essence": "The B2B SEO Trap: Why High-Intent Visibility Can Still Underperform Quality visibility that leads to quality bottom-funnel visits matters for B2B SEO. Not all bottom-of-the-funnel traffic converts, and that is ok. VIP CONTRIBUTOR Corey Morris August 20, 2025 ⋅ 10 min read VIP CONTRIBUTOR Corey Morris President / CEO at Voltage Bio Follow 36 SHARES 1.4K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> In B2B SEO, typically, the ultimate goal is to attract high-intent searchers who convert into qualified leads . But, not all high-intent visibility translates to sales-ready traffic, especially in long sales cycles or complex buying journeys. As we get deeper into an era of diminishing importance of keywords that translate directly into attributable clicks, a focus on quality of traffic is as important as ever. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. Quality has long been a critical component and key performance indicator (KPI) in the sense that most of us know our conversion rates and stages of the funnel someone might be in related to intent with B2B and lead generation. However, now, as much as ever, we have to scrutinize intent and the traffic quality even more. When SEO teams over-prioritize high-intent visibility and focus under the false assumption that intent equals urgency, we can find that we&rsquo;re not getting the conversions or leads that we expect. In this article, I&rsquo;m unpacking seven ways to help go deeper with mapping visibility to actual funnel stages, differentiating decision-makers vs. influencers, and building SEO content that nurtures, qualifies, and educates before the handoff to sales. 1. The Myth: &ldquo;If It&rsquo;s A Bottom-Of-Funnel Topic, The Traffic Is Ready To Convert&rdquo; While we may think about our website, our content, and analytics data in customer journeys and conversion funnels , our target audience doesn&rsquo;t. Maybe my nerdy search brain thinks that way when I&rsquo;m consuming content on a website I&rsquo;m interested in, but most of the world doesn&rsquo;t. There are too many variables that impact someone&rsquo;s conversion decision to fully unpack here. I can personally tell you that a couple of times, I filled out forms while lying on the floor next to one of my kids in bed, falling asleep. And, other times, I sat with a tab open on my giant desktop work monitor for months before eventually finding that tab again and filling out the form. Those are two extreme examples, but as more possible ways to be found (e.g., AI search) enter play, we&rsquo;re going to see myriad behaviors and paths that we couldn&rsquo;t have anticipated just a few years ago. Things are not going to make sense in a simple way, and what might seem like a home run conversion will be frustrating when you dig into the data, and things that might have felt like top of funnel that convert quickly will be equally (but pleasantly) surprising as well. 2.

    "essence": "Quality Audiences: Why Lower Traffic Might Be Better More traffic doesn’t always mean more value. Learn why attracting fewer, but better, visitors may be the smarter move for real business impact. Chelsea Alves August 20, 2025 ⋅ 12 min read Chelsea Alves Senior Manager, Content Marketing at Forsta Bio Follow 21 SHARES 2.0K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> There once was a time when digital marketers chased traffic. The more traffic a website attracted, the more marketers felt satisfied and closer to attaining their goals. But, this once golden metric is no longer a tell-tale sign of success. Gone are the days of forecasting growth solely on the number of visitors coming to a website. Today, lower traffic might actually be better than driving a plethora of unqualified, uninterested leads to your website. Undoubtedly, consumer search behavior looks much different than it once did. AI is stealing click-throughs, third-party cookies are essentially disappearing, and audiences give more thought to whether to click through to a website. Quality over quantity is the name of the game, and marketers are now shifting their focus towards driving better traffic rather than more traffic. In this post, we&rsquo;ll dissect why less traffic might be &ldquo;more&rdquo; and better for your business, how to shift your content marketing strategy to attract high-quality visitors, and share actionable insights for driving business results with your target audience. Table of Contents 1. The Traffic Trap: Why More Isn&rsquo;t Always Better 2. AI Has Forever Changed The Search Landscape 3. The Power Of Qualified Traffic 4. Quality Content = Better Business Outcomes 5. The Go-To Content Marketing Strategy To Drive Qualified Traffic 6. Quality Will Win The Future Of Content Marketing The Traffic Trap: Why More Isn&rsquo;t Always Better At first thought, a high volume of traffic sounds ideal. The thought of hundreds of thousands of visitors flooding your site and purchasing your products or services would be a dream. But, that&rsquo;s unfortunately not reality in most cases. It&rsquo;s a vanity metric that looks impressive in presentations but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily move the needle when it comes to sales. According to a recent study, the average website conversion rate across 14 different industries is a dismal 3.3% . That means for every 1,000 visitors, fewer than 25 of those will actually convert. And, depending on your sector, your conversion rate might be even lower. Additionally, consider if your content isn&rsquo;t optimized for the right keywords. You could be attracting traffic with zero intention or motivation to convert. In this case, these searchers are likely to bounce once they realize what you&rsquo;re selling, they have no interest in buying. The numbers may look inflated, but if the quality is lacking, those numbers are meaningless. At the end of the day, sales and revenue are the ultimate goals for any business. Drawing in the right audience leads you closer to that goal, even if the numbers aren&rsquo;t legendary. Because here&rsquo;s an uncomfortable truth: Traffic is easy to obtain; quality traffic is hard. AI Has Forever Changed The Search Landscape There&rsquo;s been much discussion around the impact of AI in the search landscape , and even some of the most seasoned SEOs are scratching their heads, wondering what to do. Google&rsquo;s rollout of AI Overviews and the rising use of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools have significantly altered the way users search for products and services. Searchers no longer need to click through on a website to get the information they need. Instead, they&rsquo;re receiving AI-generated summaries that often answer their question right away. This has resulted in businesses across the board seeing a notable decrease in traffic. Even top-ranking content that&rsquo;s been thriving in the search engine results pages (SERPs) for years has taken a hit. Bustle, the entertainment and lifestyle site, saw search traffic behave erratically last spring, around the time AI summaries were introduced. Some stories surged to 150,000-300,000 views , while most others barely cracked 1,000. In turn, SEOs and content marketers are being forced to face a new reality – what many are referring to as &ldquo;zero-click search 2.0.&rdquo; But, just as we have done with all the previous major changes in the search landscapes, the good news is we&rsquo;ll live and we&rsquo;ll adapt. It takes a mindset shift, where instead of relying on high-ranking content to drive traffic, the new goal must be to create valuable, intent-focused content that targets long-tail queries, offers helpful information, solves a problem, and is well-written (which means not relying on AI to fully draft content for you). Subject matter experts are in higher demand than ever before as relevance and trust become more paramount than ever before. The Power Of Qualified Traffic When we talk about qualified traffic, it&rsquo;s important to clearly define what exactly this means, as it can have divergent definitions. For the purposes of this post, quality audiences include searchers who: Match and align with your target personas and demographic. Arrive with specific intent (ready to make a purchase or are further along in the sales journey). Engage meaningfully with your content (visiting multiple pages on your site, higher dwell times). Often find you through word-of-mouth, email, referrals, reviews, or targeted search. Use long-tail queries to help them solve a problem they&rsquo;re facing. Now, think about the content you&rsquo;re creating and what&rsquo;s in your pipeline. If you&rsquo;re drafting generic blog posts, surface-level articles, or are relying entirely on AI to draft your content for you, you may be attracting visitors, but you likely aren&rsquo;t motivating buyers. The same can be said for advertising efforts that cast too wide of a net. The result? An influx of searchers that may have no intention of converting and no interest in your business. Your traffic count may look great, but there&rsquo;s no success behind drawing in these visitors. Consider that an email marketing provider found that email marketing has an average return on investment (ROI) of $36 for every $1 spent . It&rsquo;s well known and documented that email marketing tends to be one of the highest drivers of ROI. The reason for this is that your email audience is usually pre-qualified and opted in to receive communication from you. They know your business and what you sell, and are therefore more likely to take action. Similarly, referral traffic and direct traffic often yield higher conversion rates than social media or display ads. Getting the right people to your site is essential, and the tactics that accomplish this should be your primary focus. Quality Content = Better Business Outcomes There&rsquo;s a reason why nearly half of technology companies say their content marketing budgets will grow this year . Because content works – when it&rsquo;s done right. Content shouldn&rsquo;t be created to cast a wider net. It should be created with intentionality to grow your brand recognition , build trust with your audience, and offer the type of value that keeps people coming back. Here&rsquo;s how quality, helpful content focused on the right audience and pain points pays off: 1. Higher Conversion Rates Personalized content is a powerful driver of consumer behavior. In fact, 76% of people say tailored content influences their decision to consider a brand, and 78% say it makes them more likely to buy again. This statistic highlights the need for content that&rsquo;s personalized and targeted to searchers&rsquo; needs. Content that speaks to a specific persona or pain point is more likely to convert than a pointless listicle that&rsquo;s stuffed with basic information. 2. Improved Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) You don&rsquo;t want your customers to be one and done. Instead, you want them to come back to you any time the need arises. You want to be the brand they choose and trust over your competitors. When you draft content that is deeply relevant, helps users understand your products, educates them on all your services, or guides them towards making a more informed decision, they&rsquo;re likely to keep returning for more. 3. Lower Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) No salesperson wants to sit through a multi-year process, anxiously awaiting the day a prospect may or may not decide to move forward. Targeted content and lower funnel content attract qualified leads that lead to shorter sales cycles and lower the cost to acquire a new customer. This empowers sales teams to focus on closing rather than convincing, educating, or determining if a prospect is worth their while. 4. Stronger Brand Equity When customers find your content to be valuable, they&rsquo;re more likely to share your content with their followers on social media and refer you to their friends. Bridging the gap between awareness and consideration means building trust and drafting insightful, research-backed content. This is why content drafting can&rsquo;t be left solely to AI but should be left in the hands of skilled human writers who&rsquo;ve consulted subject matter experts to deliver the highest value content possible. Content Quality Indicators As aforementioned, traffic alone isn&rsquo;t enough to measure the quality of your content. There are numerous signals that can help you assess whether your content is working. A few key metrics content marketers should assess when evaluating the strength of their content marketing efforts include: Bounce Rate: The bigger the bounce rate, the bigger the concern. According to Siege Media, a good bounce rate for a blog is 70%, with the average being 80% . Anything more, and there is likely a fatal flaw between content and audience expectations that should be examined. Scroll Depth: Similar to bounce rate, it&rsquo;s unhelpful if your browsers aren&rsquo;t scrolling down enough to potentially become buyers. This could suggest myriad issues, such as your call to action (CTA) being too far down on the page or your content not resonating with your target audience. Time on Page: Are customers coming to your website but leaving shortly after? Short sessions on your website may imply low engagement, or your content simply isn&rsquo;t relevant to the audience. This is often the case when your keywords don&rsquo;t align with search intent, which raises the importance of thorough keyword research. Conversion Pathways: Each of your website pages likely has the goal of getting people to take action, whether that&rsquo;s filling out a form, requesting a demo, or purchasing a product. If people aren&rsquo;t clicking your CTAs, it&rsquo;s important to assess what the problem is. Perhaps your CTA is the wrong color or doesn&rsquo;t use compelling language. A/B testing can help you assess where the real problem lies. These metrics help you understand not just how many people arrived, but how many stayed and why. The Go-To Content Marketing Strategy To Drive Qualified Traffic It&rsquo;s time for a mind shift for content marketers. We&rsquo;re not abandoning growth, and we&rsquo;re not neglecting traffic, but we&rsquo;re being more intentional about our goals. More traffic doesn&rsquo;t mean more sales. It&rsquo;s time to redefine our strategies to secure success and highlight content marketing as a value-add. Here&rsquo;s the new playbook for driving qualified traffic: 1. Redefine What Success Looks Like Success looks different today than it did even a few years ago. Today, success is contingent on attracting quality leads, keeping people on your website, assessing the time to conversion, and digging into your content engagement rates. We&rsquo;re also looking at any red flags in user experience, such as long page load times, CTAs that are too far down, and intrusive ads popping up. 2. Segment Your Audience Your target audience is likely diverse, which means they inherently have different needs and preferences. To ensure your content hits the mark, it&rsquo;s crucial to segment your audience appropriately by buyer personas, new versus returning users, behavioral signals, age, and more to ensure your content lands. For example, a Gen Z customer searching for a financial services business will want vastly different information than a Boomer, who may be looking for information about retirement or estate planning. 3. Align Content With The Funnel Content must be created for all stages of the funnel. For example, a first-time buyer will likely want more awareness-level content, whereas someone at the decision stage likely wants to read case studies or product reviews. Audit your existing content to ensure you have a healthy mix of content at each stage of the funnel, including: Top of Funnel (ToFu): Awareness content that builds trust and captures attention (but should still target a specific persona). Middle of Funnel (MoFu): Educational content that helps users compare solutions, such as whitepapers, ebooks, product one-pagers, and more. Bottom of Funnel (BoFu): Case studies, reviews and testimonials, product demos, and more. 4. Invest In First-Party Data Knowing who&rsquo;s interested in your business can help you reach the right people at the right time. First-party data is invaluable, and can be sourced through email subscribers, webinar attendees, and form fills. These are the people your business wants to develop relationships with, and can do so through drip campaigns, feedback loops, and tailored content offers. 5. Optimize For Intent, Not Just Keywords Informational keywords can be helpful, but they often aren&rsquo;t going to lead to quick conversions. It can be helpful to focus on human-centered SEO , long-tail keywords (which usually are specific and solve a problem), and other types of intent-based keywords. Leverage third-party tools like Semrush, Ahrefs, or MarketMuse to uncover the why behind searches, how competitive search terms are, and how often they&rsquo;re searched for. Quality Will Win The Future Of Content Marketing In a digital-first era that&rsquo;s rife with competition, it&rsquo;s necessary to differentiate your business from others. While your competitors may be generating content quickly and at scale using AI, your brand can gain a competitive edge by doubling down on authenticity and building human-first content. Lower traffic may be getting your business down, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to lower value. In fact, for many brands, trimming the fat and focusing on quality audiences only leads to greater wins. The next time you&rsquo;re analyzing your data and notice a dip in traffic, there&rsquo;s no need to get into panic mode. Ask yourself: Did the right people visit? Is our content useful? Are these visitors driving growth? After all, traffic is just a number.

Google remains the primary referral source; ChatGPT is small but measurable. Figures are referrer-based and limited to Ahrefs Web Analytics sites. The tracker updates monthly. SEJ STAFF Matt G. Southern August 19, 2025 ⋅ 2 min read SEJ STAFF Matt G. Southern Senior News Writer at Search Engine Journal Bio Follow 27 SHARES 6.1K READS { this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }, 300);\"> Ahrefs released a public dashboard that tracks how much referral traffic websites receive from Google Search versus ChatGPT, with monthly updates. The first dataset covers three complete months across 44,421 sites connected to Ahrefs&rsquo; free Web Analytics tool. The Early Numbers For July, the dashboard reports Google at 41.9% of total web traffic across the cohort and ChatGPT at 0.19%. Month over month, Google grew 1.4% and ChatGPT grew 5.3%. The prior month showed the reverse pattern: Google +6.8% and ChatGPT +1.6%. These swings show growth rates can vary by month even as Google&rsquo;s share remains far larger. Ahrefs Traffic Analysis The dashboard states: &ldquo;ChatGPT is growing 3.8x faster than Google.&rdquo; It adds: &ldquo;With 5.3% monthly growth vs Google&rsquo;s 1.4% in the latest month, AI-powered search continues to evolve rapidly.&rdquo; And: &ldquo;ChatGPT now drives measurable referral traffic to websites, representing a new channel that didn&rsquo;t exist 2 years ago.&rdquo; How The Data Is Collected To keep the time series comparable, the tracker includes only sites that appear in all months. As the page explains: &ldquo;Our analysis tracks sites that appear in all months, ensuring statistically significant and reliable growth metrics.&rdquo; The page also lists the last update timestamp and confirms monthly updates. Important Caveats The dashboard measures referral traffic that arrives with a referrer. Some AI systems and in-app browsers add noreferrer or otherwise strip referrers, which can undercount AI-originating visits. Ahrefs has documented this analytics blind spot when measuring AI assistants and Google&rsquo;s AI Mode. Keep that limitation in mind when comparing &ldquo;AI search&rdquo; activity to traditional search. Scope matters too. The cohort is limited to sites using Ahrefs Web Analytics. Earlier Ahrefs research across different samples found AI referrals around 0.17% of the average site&rsquo;s traffic, which is directionally consistent with the 0.19% shown here. Looking Ahead Google still sends the overwhelming share of visits in this dataset, and that reality should anchor your priorities. At the same time, ChatGPT&rsquo;s July growth suggests an emerging, measurable channel you can evaluate with real data. Use the tracker to watch how both lines move over time and adjust your testing accordingly. Featured Image: JRdes /Shutterstock Category News Tools",

The vulnerability is rated high (8.8/10) on the CVSS threat severity scale. Screenshot from Wordfence advisory showing 8.8 CVSS severity rating Redirection for Contact Form 7 plugin The vulnerability affects the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin, which is installed on over 300,000 websites. The plugin extends the functionality of the popular Contact Form 7 plugin. It enables a website publisher not only to redirect a user to another page but also to store the information in a database, send email notifications, and block spammy form submissions. The vulnerability arises in a plugin function. WordPress functions are PHP code snippets that provide specific functionalities. The specific function that contains the flaw is called the delete_associated_files function. That function contains an insufficient file path validation flaw, which means it does not validate what a user can input into the function that deletes files. This flaw enables an attacker to specify a path to a file to be deleted. Thus, an attacker can specify a path (such as ../../wp-config.php) and delete a critical file like wp-config.php, clearing the way for a remote code execution (RCE) attack. An RCE attack is a type of exploit that enables an attacker to execute malicious code remotely (from anywhere on the Internet) and gain control of the website. The Wordfence advisory explains : &ldquo;This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).&rdquo; The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including version 3.2.4. Users of the affected plugin are advised to update the plugin to the latest version. Featured Image by Shutterstock/Everyonephoto Studio Category News WordPress",
