    "essence": "AI Tool Detects Prostate Cancer Missed by Pathologists A new AI tool, developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, has demonstrated the ability to identify prostate cancer in biopsy samples that human pathologists overlooked. The tool, trained on over 10,000 digitized prostate biopsy slides, achieved a 98% accuracy rate in detecting cancerous tissue, compared to the 85-90% accuracy of human pathologists in the same study. This discrepancy highlights the AI’s potential to reduce diagnostic errors, particularly in early-stage or subtle cases where cancer cells are easily missed.",
