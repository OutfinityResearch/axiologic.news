But I'm really burning out now. I just can't get it to take off, I barely make enough money to survive. The effort is just not worth it anymore. The dream I had is also slowly fading away. And I don't know what to do now. Anyone been in the same situation? How did you deal with it? Stop it all and find a simple job and try to work your way up the corporate ladder? I dont feel like I have the energy anymore to do that. And also not the qualification I think. Thanks for your input guys. Read more Share",

Members Online ‚Ä¢ FiloPietra_ How to build vertical AI applications - learnings from Legora ($675M valuation) Product Development Just came across Legora, a collaborative AI tool for lawyers, and there are some serious takeaways here for anyone building vertical AI products. Here‚Äôs what they did right imo: 1. Deep immersion with their first customer They started by shadowing a law firm in the Nordics. Literally embedding themselves into the firm, building custom AI agents and tools tailored to their workflows, and iterating nonstop. They weren‚Äôt guessing. They were learning directly from the source. 2. Productize the core solution Once they had something that worked and was delivering value, they packaged it into a product. Then they started approaching other law firms with enterprise deals. The sell was easier now: they had proof, insights, and actual customer validation. They had something that was already tailored to their ICP which made scaling just a numbers game. 3. Great branding and trust-building Their website's branding feels like Anthropic. Clean, premium, and credible. They‚Äôve also got a ‚Äútrust center‚Äù that openly details their security certifications, frameworks, and data safety protocols, which is a huge deal in the legal field where trust is everything. üëá And that's pretty much it. Somehow they built a $675M company in just 13 months. And you know what? The founder didn‚Äôt even come from the legal world. So, the framework they used (and you can too): Identify a B2B industry that‚Äôs outdated and ready for disruption (like the legal sector) Shadow a real customer. Build for them. Learn everything. Do it for free at first, and once it works, they‚Äôll be the first ones to pay. Worst case, you can immediately sell to someone else Use that success and social proof to land more clients, and the snowball effect starts. Depending on your ambitions and the industry‚Äôs demands, either raise VC funding or stay bootstrapped. If you wanna become the leader and have monopoly, probably the vc route is better (in certain industries like law, the cost of being taken seriously (security, compliance, infrastructure) might push you toward raising capital.); else stay lean and agile with high margins. But the core idea is simple: Don‚Äôt build in isolation. Build with your customer. What do you think? Read more Share",

I really like my idea and the opportunities that could arise from it, and i came to the realization that it is not that easy to work on it on my own, especially the fact that im a medical graduate and the studies sometimes are long and deep. Regardless, I thought why not see if my best friends are interested, the reality of the situation is that life isnt treating everyone the same so they all said tough for them, so i dont know what to do, raw dog it on my own, im not saying it is impossible, but i love working with people because ideas get broader in some sense.

Members Online ‚Ä¢ meemaw1234 I built a platform to make acquisition insights affordable & actionable Tools and Technology Hi everyone! I‚Äôve always been frustrated seeing people pay $100+ just to access and analyze acquisition data. As someone genuinely curious about acquisitions, I realized how hard (and expensive) it was to get clear insights on who‚Äôs buying what, which industries are hot, and what patterns actually drive exits. Instead of paying for scattered, overpriced reports, I decided to build Acquirezy - a platform where you can explore 30,000+ real acquisition deals and use ChaseAI, an AI trained on this data, to uncover acquisition-friendly niches, validate startup ideas, and run smarter market research. Whether you‚Äôre an entrepreneur, indie hacker, or investor, the goal is to make acquisition insights both affordable and actionable. Reach out to me if you guys need link to product.

Members Online ‚Ä¢ Fun_Signature_9812 Controversial Take: A Startup's Funding Strategy Should Be A 'Fail-Fast' Test, Not a Grind. Growth and Expansion I've been thinking a lot about the typical funding path (bootstrapping -> angel -> VC) and I have a different take. I believe this model is inefficient and leads to founders wasting years on a failed idea. Here‚Äôs my proposed model: Crowdfunding is the ultimate validation tool. It's a binary test. If you can‚Äôt convince a large group of people to pre-pay for your product on Kickstarter or Indiegogo, your idea isn't validated by the market. Period. You should immediately shut down the existing business and either move on or pivot to a new idea. There‚Äôs no point in burning more time and money on a product that the public doesn't want. If crowdfunding is successful, it's a huge win! You've not only secured initial capital but, more importantly, you've received market validation . Over a thousand people just put their money where their mouth is. This makes you a much more attractive candidate for other funding types. Next, go for government funding, not private investors. Most successful crowdfunding campaigns are for products that genuinely improve people's lives (e.g., sustainable tech, health gadgets, educational tools). This aligns perfectly with the goals of many government grants and programs, which are often non-dilutive and focused on the greater good. Your crowdfunding success is a powerful piece of evidence to show them. Private investors should be your last resort. VCs and angel investors are primarily focused on one thing: maximizing profit. They often require you to sacrifice a lot of equity and control. Why go to them first when you can build a more stable, non-dilutive company by leveraging public and government support first? Only after you‚Äôve explored these avenues and have a massive, proven-out business model should you consider bringing in private money. Thoughts? Is this too harsh? Is the \"fail-fast\" crowdfunding model a better path to success than the traditional fundraising grind? Read more Share",

Members Online ‚Ä¢ Fun_Signature_9812 I took your feedback, scrapped my old plan, and built a new one. Can you help me find the flaws in this one, too? Starting a Business Hi everyone, a huge thank you for the feedback on my last post about a 3-in-1 cyber cafe/coding/SaaS business in Kolkata. The comments were brutal, but they were exactly what I needed to hear. The overwhelming consensus was that the three businesses would conflict, and that a cyber cafe is a dying model that would cripple the more promising ventures. I've taken all of your advice and completely scrapped the old plan. I've re-imagined the idea from the ground up, focusing on a single, integrated \"tech hub\" model. My goal is to find all the major points of failure in this new plan before I move forward with a business proposal and crowdfunding. Here's the new model: The Core Concept: An Integrated Tech Hub 1. The Space: From Cyber Cafe to Co-Working. Instead of a generic cyber cafe, I will create a professional, membership-based co-working space dedicated exclusively to tech talent (freelancers, developers, designers) in a prime location in Kolkata. This is a single, high-value business in itself, with a strong revenue stream from memberships. The space is a feature, not a liability. 2. The Academy: From Lessons to a Project-Based Bootcamp. This is a premium, intensive bootcamp. We don't just teach code; we train for a real-world project. I will charge a tuition fee (or use an Income Sharing Agreement) for a structured, time-bound curriculum. 3. The Projects: From Bidding to Capstone Deliverables. I will source small-scale government tenders or real client projects. These are not competitive bids; they are the final, real-world capstone project for a team of bootcamp students. The students gain a portfolio piece and a formal certification. The business gains a working product and IP to monetize. This model is focused, addresses the \"why in-person\" question by offering a community and a physical space, and solves the ethical and IP concerns by making the project a formal part of the training agreement. My Big Question for You: Where are the hidden risks or points of failure in this new plan? I'm specifically looking for your feedback on these areas: Market Risk: Is there a strong enough demand for a dedicated tech co-working space in Kolkata, or will I struggle with membership? Is the market for a high-end coding bootcamp saturated? Execution Risk: Can a single founder manage the massive overhead of both running a physical space and a high-touch educational program? What are the biggest logistical nightmares I'm not seeing? Financial Risk: What are the unexpected costs associated with running a professional co-working space? Is the pricing model for the bootcamp and memberships viable? Talent Risk: Will I be able to consistently attract high-quality students who can produce a professional-grade final product? How do I ensure the quality of the projects and the students? Thanks again for the incredible support. I'm ready for the tough love, so please don't hold back. Read more Share",

Members Online ‚Ä¢ thalavaisankar7 We want to build an open-source SaaS project (but we don‚Äôt know what problem to solve yet). What‚Äôs the biggest pain you‚Äôre facing? Recommendations Hey folks üëã We‚Äôre two bootstrapped founders hacking away on SaaS projects, and we‚Äôve been thinking about doing something different: üëâ Build an open-source SaaS product that anyone here can contribute to . Here‚Äôs the catch: We don‚Äôt want to pick a random problem out of thin air. Instead, we‚Äôd love to build something that solves a real pain people in this community are facing. Some thoughts we had: Should it be something that helps other bootstrappers? A tool for early validation? Something in the ‚Äúboring but useful‚Äù category (like forms, docs, or scheduling)? Or maybe a productivity hack founders actually want? We don't know yet -- and that's the exciting part. The plan: Collect problems idea from this community. Vote/discuss what feels most valuable. Build it in public, open-source, and let anyone contribute. Share updates here so everyone can see the progress (and jump in if they want). We know it might flop, But even if it does, at at least we'll all learn something together. So, what do you think? üëâ What's a problem you face as an entrepreneur/founder that you wish had a simple SaaS solutions? Let's build something useful together. Read more Share",

Members Online ‚Ä¢ im_hvsingh after advising 50+ hotel tech implementations, here's what i'd do differently Best Practices been consulting on hospitality technology for 8 years. helped properties ranging from 20-room b&bs to 500-room conference centers. looking back, there are definitely patterns in what works and what doesn't. what i used to get wrong: 1. led with features instead of problems would show clients amazing demos with every possible bell and whistle. half the features never got used, and training became a nightmare. 2. trusted vendor timelines if they said 6 weeks, i'd tell clients 8 weeks. should have said 12. software implementations always take longer than promised. 3. didn't prioritize staff adoption enough picked technically superior solutions that front desk staff hated. doesn't matter how good the system is if people won't use it properly. what i do now: start with research phase using platforms like hoteltechreport - real user reviews from similar properties matter more than marketing materials. though you have to filter out the obvious fake reviews. prototype with actual staff before any major decision. the night auditor who's been there 10 years knows more about workflow than any consultant. plan for 30% longer implementation than vendor estimates. always. focus on core functionality first - can always add fancy features later once the basics are solid. biggest lesson: the \"best\" system is the one that actually gets used properly. sometimes that's not the most technically advanced option. consulting is humbling. you think you know what clients need until reality hits during implementation.

Members Online ‚Ä¢ MrCharmingMan Got kicked out of a Pharmaceutical Sales conference from the man in charge of the conference Sales Leadership Focused Got kicked out of a Pharmaceutical Sales conference from the man in charge of the conference. So we sell to all the heavy hitter sales teams(Insurance, Pharmaceutical, Tech, Real estate etc.) I already landed one of the biggest if not the biggest pharmaceutical sales teams already and so they invited me to this pharmaceutical sales conference going on soon. I appreciated them inviting me as there will be a ton of other pharmaceutical sales teams there in attendance that I can network with and ideally close as well. So I sign up for the conference fill out the registration honestly and pay for everything and everything gets processed and then a day later the owner of the conference contacts me in my office asking me why I want to attend the conference since he sees im not from a pharmaceutical company but from a tech sales company. I tell him the truth that I was invited by so and so and what my ideal goals were by attending it. He then says oh no you wont be able to network and talk with them as they are all too busy learning and already being pitched by all the other pharmaceutical companies etc. He then cancels my registration and revokes my conference badges and refunds me of course. I dont get why he was like this because I was very honest and transparent why I was even attending. I then asked him does he know of any better pharmaceutical sales conferences/trade shows I can attend that would be better for me to network and land them as clients and he said no right away. I think he felt threatened as if he didn't want his competition to get one up on him? I dont know it seems rather strange how aggressive he was in kicking me out of the conference when a lot of conferences are pretty much open and welcoming to all people even of other industries. What do you guys think? What are some of the best pharmaceutical sales conference to attend to try to land new pharmaceutical sales teams as new accounts and clients? Please let me know. Thanks!

Lately I've been thinking about how, some people working in the big prestigious companies and roles e.g Management Consultants, can literally be pulling in $300k and more annual salary. Of course, they usually also have good background like good degree and grades, internships, experience, skills, performing well in interviews etc. that's why they got into their roles. But I'm over here only earning between 60-70k+ per annum in a finance job(but not prestigious or big firm) and I'm stuck wondering how am I ever gonna catch up to these people.

Members Online ‚Ä¢ ClockSelect1976 SDR to Enterprise AE at Google - Advice and Reflection Sales Careers I‚Äôm leaving my SMB sales gig to join Google in a few weeks, where I‚Äôll finally be aligned to strategic enterprise accounts in the field. Wanted to write my experience both as an artifact to myself and to pay back this forum as the knowledge here was integral in getting me to where I am. I get a lot of DMs about this so I am making a post. My background isn‚Äôt anything special. Bachelors degree in an unrelated major from a decent school. Did some sales internships and got lucky to break into an SDR role at a big cloud hyperscaler right out of school. I got promoted a couple times and got a fairly desirable AE role working SMB and MM accounts. A.) Would I do tech sales again/ is SDR worth it? Being an SDR is a tough job. Cold outreach day in and day out can be mentally taxing. Some days I phoned it in and hardly got anything done. I felt like an idiot that harasses IT help desks all day. That being said, the time you spend as an SDR really is foundational to a good tech sales career. More importantly, it serves as a filter. If you don‚Äôt have the mental fortitude to keep grinding, or the discipline to get up every day and run the motions, or the courage to pick up the phone, you aren‚Äôt going to make it in this line of work. And that‚Äôs okay. Plenty of my old peers have found great careers elsewhere - they all landed on their feet. Being an SDR is not life changing and honestly you don‚Äôt need to do it for 3 years to learn the skills you‚Äôll need. But you do get a stamp on your wrist that says you paid the price of admission for the next room. I worked 8-5 typical hours, didn‚Äôt work crazy times of the day. Didn‚Äôt reinvent the wheel or contribute to an insane win. Most of everything I did amounted to nothing. The job is mostly what you read about it. But if you persist then there is opportunity to make serious money. Is it super meaningful? No. But most jobs aren‚Äôt. Take the SDR job - it‚Äôs worth it. B.) My advice: 1.) Be confident. Don‚Äôt be cocky, but you can get away with a lot if you carry yourself and speak confidently. 2.) Performance is table stakes. To move to AE, being a top SDR is a minimum prerequisite. 3.) Politics matter A LOT. If you want to be an AE, you need to get your manager, your manager‚Äôs manager, your future manager (AE manager), and their manager all aligned that you are next up. 4.) Be easy to manage. Do your trainings on time. Maintain SFDC hygiene. Meet the KPIs in your control. This will help with point #3. 5.) FILO. First in last out. Get there before everyone else and work until they leave. If you‚Äôre the best performer, they‚Äôll chalk it up to you being such a hard worker. If you aren‚Äôt doing well on paper, you‚Äôll get a lot more slack from leadership. This brings me to my most important point 6.) Perception is reality. Are you the best on customer calls? Doesn‚Äôt matter if nobody hears. Do the things that are visible and your leadership cares about, discard everything else. 7.) Know thy enemy. Somebody in your org doesn‚Äôt like you. Identify these individuals quickly and avoid them. It only takes a single voice of dissent to silence a room of generally positive feedback. 8.) High ROI activities only. If calling works and emails don‚Äôt, then fake your email KPI the best you can and hammer calls. 9.) Copy the best. Obvious but people are too prideful to reach out and ask for help. 10.) Save your money. You need to be maxing out your 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA. This amounts to close to $35k per year. I understand that if you‚Äôre making $75k all in as an SDR then this is tough, but try to get as close as you can. Live with roommates, ride a bike to work, live with parents. Tech sales is all about making as much money as quickly as possible. It only means something if you are highly diligent in saving and investing. 11.) Control your destiny. So many of my old peers are still in SDR purgatory because they feel entitled to promotions or expected them to come naturally once they ‚Äúlearned the ropes‚Äù or ‚Äúthe right role opened up‚Äù. Nobody is going to take ownership of your career but you. You are your only advocate. Fight. C.) Why am I leaving to a new role? Lots of reasons. I broke a lot of my own rules listed above. Tired of the high volume in SMB. Underpaid for my level. It‚Äôs also best for my career. If I don‚Äôt make the best move at any given moment, what‚Äôs the point? D.) Note to my future self: I used to pray every night for a chance at this career. After that I prayed for this job. I am so grateful to have it, to have succeeded in it, and be moving to something even better. I am proud of myself and who I‚Äôve become. Nothing was given to me - I earned every penny I was paid. I will take everything I want at all costs to myself and to others. I pray for your success. Until next time, I‚Äôm sure future adventures will make for more great stories.

Members Online ‚Ä¢ coolsoy Feeling overwhelmed and blind-sided by CEO - what should I do? Sales Topic General Discussion Hey guys, mid-market SAAS AE here, currently working in a post Series A start-up that's doing around <$5M in ARR, I was hired as the second AE to help them start their outbound motion (that's been my experience helping startups do outbound) and also handle some of the incoming leads to help their first AE (who has been with the company since the beginning and handles all inbound requests). Currently, I learned that they are measuring me on the same number of deals to close per quarter as the first AE (who handles all inbound requests) while wanting me to build an outbound motion and then blind-siding me by making the AE my manager without prior notice (the CEO was managing me before but would rarely talk to me and had no 1 on 1s with me) Bottom-line: I am burnt-out since I am handling outbound leads that will take longer to close but still being measured on inbound metrics, building the outbound motion, and just not really feeling part of the team because of the blind-siding and lack of communication about metrics. Its been less than 6 months for me in this role and I am just so tired. Regardless, what do you guys think of this situation? Should I stay? Should I go? Cotton-eyed Joe? Happy to provide more context if needed. Thanks guys Read more Share",

Members Online ‚Ä¢ WarrenTrader He turned a $100 mistake into a $1,000 side hustle without even planning to Success Story A friend of mine accidentally ordered the wrong product online. Instead of going through the hassle of returning it, he listed it on Facebook Marketplace just to see if someone would buy it. To his surprise, it sold within 24 hours. Even more surprising the buyer asked if he had more to sell. That sparked an idea. He ordered 10 more units from the same supplier, listed them, and they were gone within a week. Three months later, that little ‚Äúmistake‚Äù snowballed into a small side hustle that cleared over $1,000 in profit. Nothing fancy, no complex business plan just testing something small that happened by accident. The whole thing made me realize, sometimes opportunity shows up disguised as a problem, most ‚Äúbusiness ideas‚Äù don‚Äôt start with big plans, they start with tiny experiments, you don‚Äôt need permission to start just curiosity and a willingness to try. I wonder how many people here have had something random or accidental turn into a side hustle or even a full time gig? Read more Share",

Members Online ‚Ä¢ 607beforecommonera If you could sell any software/app, what would you sell in this market? Who's buying? Sales Topic General Discussion I'm considering putting together a portfolio of software to sell under my LLC and partnering 1099 with reps that are coasting looking for additional products to farm and possibly building them what they want to sell. Here's where I'm at: with my skillset, I can build/host/distribute pretty much any software/system (not vibe-coded garbage), from enterprise-grade webapps or systems to small cross-platform software. I feel like buyers probably are fatigued of \"AI\" everything, but I still have experience building AI-adjacent tools and consulting. I just can't decide what would be best in this market. If you could sell any software/app, what would you sell in this market? Before anyone says something about the 1099, I haven't made any postings on job boards yet, but am planning to offer a relatively high-percent (EDIT 35-40+ percent 55-70+ percent) of revenue per-sale to make it fair and worth their time.

    "essence": "Go to sales r/sales ‚Ä¢ salesdevcoach SDR Manager to AE/SDR Couple of weeks back I posted about going from SDR Manager back to SDR. The consensus was pretty much \"don't\" and completely valid. Challenge I'm facing currently is that my history has been in companies in \"growth mode\" in which haven't really panned out (was part of a \"unicorn\" who has done something like 7 rounds of layoffs over 3ish years lol). Had a conversation with a career counselor of sorts. Because of my tenures in the roles (didn't leave any, just poor choices on my part) they recommend getting into some marquee brands where I'll get recognized in the future and stay there for a couple of years. I want to go to an AE role (have experience but it was 4 years ago) and the reality is that I'd be competing against higher quality candidates, obviously. So the next step would be to go the \"promotion\" route as an SDR in a large company and make my way up. I have no real problems with this, I want to work for myself as IC, don't really care of the title (I've also have been coaching SDRs and have been in the trenches with them. I know whats needed to be successful). The bias I'm faced with is from the outside. Managers may not want to hire someone who's been a manager, others could ask themselves \"why would a manager go back to an SDR? how hard did they fail?\" (this question can also be asked in the future. Honestly fair questions but the answer is \"because I want to\". The stripped down version of this is: I want to enjoy my day again by selling. I want to sell to give my kids experiences I didn't have growing up. I want to actually be able to enjoy those experiences with them. I don't have a real question and no real career mentor to work these thoughts through so obviously I go to strangers online for thoughts. Read more Share",

Company has plenty of AMs doing existing but he wants a couple of hunters for new logos.

I‚Äôm consistent, I keep going thru any ups and downs‚Äù He then wrapped things up and asked if I had questions, which I did spend another 5-7 minutes asking 4 or 5 specifics things. I ended with asking something like ‚ÄúI know you are likely hiring for a specific profile but do you have any concerns with how I present based on not having prior outside sales experience (only inside)‚Äù and he indicated that he did not, and that he is def looking for a profile - someone who is tenacious and willing to work hard and not lie and fill the funnel with fluff etc. This is a bit more than I was going to give but basically, here asking your opinions Chat am I cooked?

I find myself going through the motions without really caring. I feel like the only way I get paid is if I push hard for a same-day close, and that pressure makes me feel gross and unnatural. Instead of feeling motivated, I‚Äôve started dreading appointments. Sometimes I even hope customers cancel just so I don‚Äôt have to deal with it. When I‚Äôm actually in an appointment, I‚Äôll skip steps, not follow the process, and it shows ‚Äî I leave feeling like I didn‚Äôt give my best effort. The weird thing is, I‚Äôve done well in sales before, I'm on my second month on this job and I've hit both spectrums. Had a really good first month and now I'm bringing up the rear. I did well in car sales as my last job, so I know I can succeed. But here I feel forced into being a pushy closer, and it feels like doesn‚Äôt fit me at all despite success in the first month. The more I think about it, the more I wonder if this is even sustainable long-term, especially if I already feel this checked out. Has anyone else gone through this? Did you push through and find a way to make it work, or was it a sign to move on to a different sales environment? Thank you to all who reply with good intentions. Read more Share",

After I finally started sharing my app publicly, I‚Äôve already come across 2 new products with the exact same concept. It feels a little surreal.
