The author, who had initially found no direct competitors during extensive research, was surprised to see two new products mimicking their app concept shortly after going public. This raises questions about whether idea exposure accelerates competition or if it’s simply a coincidence.",

      "It’s not a coincidence—ideas are cheap, execution is everything, so focus on building a better product faster than they can.",
      "Competitors popping up means you’ve validated a real market need, so double down on differentiation and customer loyalty.",
      "If your idea is that easy to copy, you weren’t the first to think of it—study why others failed and pivot to what makes you truly unique."

The author humorously describes the experience as 90% \"figuring it out as you go\"—a mix of frantic Googling, trial-and-error experimentation, and moments of unexpected success. This sentiment resonates deeply with many entrepreneurs, who often feel like they’re \"winging it\" more than they’d like to admit.",
