Members Online • Veil-of-Venus Is this a scam company? Young Entrepreneur I have an upcoming interview with Mellow Media Ltd company but I am starting to believe they are not real. Their web is not consistent with information and looks terrible while offering web-desing services (for £100-200) alongside other products which do not make sense to be offered by the same company How do I make sure they are real?

Members Online • Egyptianreggae33 Looking to validate my idea - new entrepreneurs/founders please read. Lessons Learned Hello everyone, I am putting together a digital program for early-stage founders, and I'd love to validate whether I am solving the right problems. Over the past 8+ years, working with 200+ start-ups as a UX researcher, designer,prucer and product manager, I noticed something: no matter the industry, early (but sometimes even experienced) founders tend to suffer from the same things: - Skipping idea validation altogether, losing money and time in the process -Not defining a clear, unique value proposition ( sometimes not even making a benchmarking, before starting to build) -Mixed messages between stakeholders, founder pitch vs communication on the socials website ( customer doesn't understand what the company is about and what he needs to do, what is the offer, but when you ask a team, they explain it very well, but struggle to build a storytelling for their product communication) -Ineffecti",

I am hoping for YouTube channels or videos that actually teach the real side of entrepreneurship, whether that’s running a local business, building systems, managing cash flow, dealing with people, or learning from the hard lessons of failure and adaptation. Basically, how to actually think and operate like an entrepreneur in both online and offline contexts.

Members Online • Mike_YTer I Finally made the pivot. Sales Careers I’ve been in door-to-door for a while now. I cut my teeth in solar, built and ran teams, and honestly found a ton of success in that space. It taught me how to recruit, how to lead, and how to sell at a high level. But earlier this year I made a pivot into fiber optic sales… and I can honestly say it’s been one of the best decisions I’ve made. Here’s why: • My guys are crushing it — the commissions are consistent, the product is a no-brainer, and the installs happen fast (none of that 3–6 month wait like in solar). • Reps are walking away with $800–$1,200+ days just by putting in work. • The demand is huge. Fiber is the future — people want faster internet, and it’s an easy sell when you can beat out old cable speeds and pricing. For anyone who hasn’t looked into it: • It’s recurring service, not a one-time purchase like solar. • It’s affordable for homeowners, so you don’t face the “big-ticket objection wall.” • You can scale quickly — more deals, more reps, more installs. I’m curious — has anyone else here made the jump from high-ticket door-to-door (solar, roofing, alarms, etc.) into a recurring service like fiber or utilities? What was your experience? How do you see the trade-off between lifetime earnings vs. the big commi",

Members Online • mddanishyusuf 7 Days After Acquiring My Second Online Business - What Happened Success Story Last week, I shared here that I bought my second online business - a Chrome extension called SuperDev Pro (a bundle of tools for developers/designers like CSS inspection, font detection, color pickers, etc.). That post blew up (170k+ views) and a lot of you asked for an update. So here are the numbers from my first full week running it: 7-day stats: 💵 $4,300 revenue 👥 7.68k visitors 🎟️ 150+ lifetime licenses sold 📥 500 new installs 🔗 Domain Rating jumped +8 (now DR 15) 🏆 Hit #1 on Peerlist of the week A few reflections so far: Design + SEO matters. I re-designed the website and tweaked SEO - traffic and conversions noticeably improved. Momentum compounds. The exposure from Peerlist + Reddit gave a strong push early on. Post-acquisition is real work. Buying the product is the easy part - now the focus is on scaling, keeping users happy, and planning long-term monetization. I’m still learning a ton, but it’s exciting to see traction this quickly. Has anyone else here seen big movement in the first week after buying a business? Would love to hear your experiences.

Members Online • ArthurDaTrainDayne Anyone Else Need a Babysitter? How Do I? I launched my online training business about 3 months ago, and am in the process of opening up a physical space as well. I have never been inundated with so many apps, interfaces, logins etc. in my life. It feels like every new door I open, there’s 5 more doors behind it, and 4 of them are trying to scam me. I’m not asking for the pep talk or anything like that, and im not trying to make excuses for myself. If continuing to grind it out myself is what I need to do, it’s what I’ll do. Organization and systems is something I’ve always struggled with. I never had a pencil in middle school and I still leave cabinet doors open at 33 years old. Regardless of how much I work at it, my gut tells me it will always be a deficit. I just feel like I create so much more value when I’m spending a majority of my time communicating, creating, connecting, and building a brand with a strong message that is reflected in the companies principles. Delivering service and results, and teaching those principles to trainers. The reason I come to you guys is: have any of you guys with similar traits to mine managed to find a “babysitter” of sorts? Really I guess it would be a director of operations. Just someone who basically puts me in the right place at the right time so I can do my thing without distractions. If you did, do you find them through personal connections? How did you bring them on in terms of pay structure/equity etc? My gut is telling me to leverage my strengths here. I think at this rate I will get burnt out by system maintenance before I even hit 1/2 capacity. And I feel extremely confident about the business model once it’s fully functional, so why not go all in? But I also worry I’m being too impulsive. My business is so young, am I screwing my self longterm by bringing someone else in? Do I set myself up for disaster by relying on someone else for key processes? Are there certain precautions I can take to limit risks? tl;dr baby want baba Read more Share",

Lessons Learned Hey everyone, I'm a big believer in growing through partnerships, but actually setting them up can be a huge headache.. For me, the most frustrating part has always been the tech side trying to track sales from different systems and then manually splitting the payments at the end of the month. It's slow and always feels like it's about to break. I'm curious to hear from other business owners. When you think about a JV, what's the biggest thing that makes you hesitate? Read more Share",

Members Online • Nightman233 People who have taken VC money. Do you regret it and what would you do differently? Growth and Expansion In a position where I am being proposed a VC like investment (although in real estate) from a fund and deciding what to do. I would likely be able to scale quicker with these guys (although not guaranteed) but would have to give up 20% of the company after their investment amount hits a certain threshold. I could buy them out but would be very expensive. I dont HAVE to do this deal but only have about 6-9 months of cushion left if none of my deals close and would have to raise money deal by deal. I would keep all of the company this way but may take longer to scale. Anyone have experience taking VC money and regretted it down the road or any pitfalls to lookout for? Is slow and steady better?

Members Online • thalavaisankar7 I analyzed 50 founder postmortems -- here are the top 5 reasons startups fail Bootstrapping I’ve been obsessed with reading founder postmortems lately. The raw honesty in those stories is way more valuable than the “10x growth hacks” floating around the internet. So I dug into 50 different startup failure stories and looked for patterns. Here’s what came up again and again: No real problem solved : Founders built things they thought were cool, not things people actually needed. No distribution strategy: “If you build it, they will come” doesn’t work. Amazing products died because nobody knew they existed. Co-founder drama: Misaligned goals, burnout, or trust issues killed startups faster than bad code ever could. Pricing mistakes: Either undercharging (unsustainable) or overcharging (no adoption). Pricing experiments came too late. Burning out: Many founders just ran out of energy (or money) before they found traction. Persistence mattered more than brilliance. Takeaway for me as a bootstrapper: It’s not just about what you build. It’s about why , for who , and whether you can actually reach them without running yourself into the ground. Curious: If you’ve failed at a project before, which of these was the killer? Or did you run into something completely different? Read more Share",

What other industries have you found success in? For me, I’ve worked in a variety of sales roles over the years, but right now I’m in B2B sales for a heavy equipment manufacturer, primarily selling to contractors. Out of all the sales jobs I’ve had, this one has been the best by far. The pay, benefits, company culture, and the people—both colleagues and customers are all great. However, what I really appreciate is how refreshing it’s been to sell to this demographic. Sure, there’s stress like in any sales job, but I’ve truly found my niche here. Read more Share",

Members Online • MightyLolbar Switching from finance to sales Sales Careers *posting for my bro because he doesn't have the upvote requirements for the sub yet Hey all, I'll keep this as short as possible and direct. I am thinking about switching jobs from working in finance to sales. I have almost 5 years of experience working for a US based M&A company and I've over worked on over 60 deals throughout this period. All working from home, remotely in Croatia. Lately, it feels like there is no money in the market at all and everything came to a halt. I've applied to well over finance 500 jobs, both on-site and remote with the majority of the companies not even giving me an interview. Closing anything feels pretty much impossible, unless you are working at the top tier banks or institutions, which I am sadly not. I feel like it would be a lot easier and more stable to find a job in sales, remotely if possible. Any tips on what I could do and where I should look to transition as fast as possible, while also making sure that I land a good, stable job that pays decently? Any help would be appreciated.

The draft agreement says disputes follow California law, but the manufacturer wants it switched to Ontario. From what I’ve read, CA law protects reps and voids foreign venue clauses, especially for commission disputes. Has anyone dealt with this? Do you just insist on keeping CA as the venue, or is it normal for manufacturers (esp. outside the U.S.) to push for their home turf? Read more Share",

Members Online • rosesmellikepoopoo Starting as a CSM but only ever been a BDR - not sure what to expect Sales Careers Hi Reddit, I’m being hired by a leading tech company as a CSM, which I’m super excited for. Worked so fucking hard for the interview and it was a long process. I come from a tech sales (BDR) and recruitment background. I’m a bit unsure of what to expect. I’ll be given about 100-200 existing accounts. I’m assuming my day to day will be contacting them by email/phone/in person and selling/supporting/chatting. I have a bit of an idea of what the company does, but they have hundreds of products so will be a lot to learn. Any tips or advice you’d give me? I’m a little unsure what to expect and not sure what they’re going to expect from me in my first couple weeks. Appreciate all comments :) thanks Read more Share",
