    "essence": "The phrase \"B2B pays. B2C is sexy\" captures a fundamental truth in entrepreneurship: business-to-business (B2B) ventures often deliver more stable, profitable outcomes, while business-to-consumer (B2C) startups attract more attention and excitement but come with higher risks and challenges. Understanding this distinction is crucial for founders deciding which path to pursue.",
    "reactions": [
      "The B2B path might be less flashy but offers stability and predictable revenue, making it a smarter long-term play for entrepreneurs who value consistency over hype.",
      "B2C startups attract more attention and can scale faster, but the high churn and marketing costs make profitability harder to achieve without massive funding.",
      "The choice between B2B and B2C depends on your goals\u2014if you want quick growth and buzz, B2C is exciting, but if you prefer steady cash flow and loyal clients, B2B is the way to go."
