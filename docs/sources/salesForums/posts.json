    "essence": "How to Approach Highly Specialized Doctors (Cardiologists & Neurosurgeons) as a Fresher in Medical Device Sales Key Tactic: Leverage \"Clinical Evidence First\" + \"Micro-Networking\" Specialists like cardiologists and neurosurgeons are inundated with sales pitches but respond to data-driven, patient-centric approaches. Instead of cold outreach, use recent clinical trial data (e.g., a 2023 study showing a 30% reduction in stroke recurrence with a specific device) as an entry point. Pair this with micro-networking—identify a nurse, PA, or fellow who works closely with the specialist and can vouch for your credibility.",
    "reactions": [
      "Practical Application: \"Start by shadowing senior reps to learn the jargon and pain points—cardiologists hate vague pitches, so focus on outcomes like reduced procedure times or improved patient recovery rates.",
      "Risks & Anti-Patterns: \"Avoid cold-calling with generic scripts; one doctor called it out: 'If you can’t name three studies on your device, don’t waste my time.'",
      "Metrics & Validation: \"Track engagement by measuring how often you’re invited to grand rounds—one rep doubled meetings after presenting data on cost savings per case."
