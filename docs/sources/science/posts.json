    "essence": "New findings on mitochondrial protein import: 1) What was found: Caltech researchers discovered that up to 20% of mitochondrial proteins are imported during translation (cotranslational import), not just after. These proteins are large, complex, and prone to misfolding if fully synthesized in the cytosol. The process relies on a mitochondrial targeting sequence plus a second signal—a large protein domain emerging from the ribosome.",
    "reactions": [
      ") The study identifies a previously overlooked cotranslational import pathway for ~20% of mitochondrial proteins, suggesting protein folding complexity as a key determinant—a finding that challenges the long-held post-translational import dogma.",

Key Findings: - Mechanism: In a mouse stomach injury model, cells undergoing paligenosis (a reprogramming to stem cell-like states) expelled waste through membrane cavities, bypassing slow lysosomal digestion.",
    "reactions": [
      "Research Significance: A comment from a cell biologist noted that cathartocytosis challenges the assumption that lysosomal degradation is the sole mechanism for cellular waste removal, suggesting this discovery could rewrite textbooks on cellular repair mechanisms.",

    "essence": "New Insights on Cannabis Use, Paranoia, and Childhood Trauma Researchers from King’s College London and the University of Bath have uncovered a critical link between why people start using cannabis and their risk of developing paranoia, anxiety, and depression. Using data from Cannabis & Me—the largest survey of its kind—two studies reveal that self-medication for pain, anxiety, or depression significantly increases paranoia compared to recreational use. Those who began using cannabis to cope consumed an average of 206 THC units weekly (roughly 10–17 joints), but self-medicators averaged 248–286 units, highlighting a dangerous cycle of higher consumption and worsening mental health.",
    "reactions": [
      "Research Significance: The study’s novelty lies in quantifying THC consumption in \"units\" (like alcohol units) and linking self-medication motives to higher paranoia, but critics note the cross-sectional design limits causal claims—longitudinal data would strengthen the findings.",
      "Practical Applications: The proposed THC unit system could aid harm reduction, but experts caution that without standardized potency labeling (as seen in alcohol), real-world adoption may face challenges due to cannabis product variability.",
      "Broader Impact: The link between childhood trauma and paranoia exacerbation by cannabis underscores the need for trauma-informed mental health interventions, though some commenters argue the study’s focus on \"emotional abuse\" over other traumas (e.g., neglect) is an oversight."

    "essence": "Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery about the rapid heating and evolution of the Spirograph Nebula (IC 418), a young planetary nebula located about 4,400 light-years away in the constellation Lepus. The study, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, reveals that the nebula’s central star has been heating up at an astonishing rate—around 20,000 to 30,000 degrees Kelvin per year—over the past 130 years. This finding provides unprecedented insight into the late-stage evolution of stars and the formation of planetary nebulae.",
    "reactions": [
      "Research Significance: This study provides a rare, direct observation of a planetary nebula's rapid evolution, offering new insights into stellar heating rates and post-AGB star transitions, which could refine theoretical models of stellar evolution.",
      "Practical Applications: While this research doesn't directly enable new technologies, it enhances our understanding of stellar processes, which may improve stellar age-dating techniques and inform future studies of galactic chemical evolution.",
      "Broader Impact: The findings contribute to our knowledge of how stars like our Sun will eventually evolve, potentially influencing astrobiology by clarifying the conditions that shape planetary systems during late-stage stellar phases."

The research, published in Nature Medicine, analyzed data from over 5,700 participants over decades and revealed that those with two copies of the APOE4 gene (which increases Alzheimer’s risk 12-fold) benefited most from the diet, showing a marked reduction in cognitive decline. Key Findings: - Genetic Protection: The diet’s protective effect was strongest in APOE4 homozygous individuals, suggesting it may offset some genetic risk.",
    "reactions": [
      "Research Significance: A neuroscientist on Reddit noted that the study’s strength lies in its longitudinal design and metabolomic analysis, but criticized the lack of mechanistic clarity—while the Mediterranean diet’s benefits are statistically significant, the exact metabolic pathways modulating APOE4 risk remain speculative.",
      "Practical Applications: A geriatrician highlighted the immediate clinical relevance, stating that while genetic testing for APOE4 isn’t routine, the findings reinforce dietary counseling as a low-cost, accessible intervention for high-risk patients, though implementation would require dietary education programs.",
      "Broader Impact: A public health researcher pointed out that the study’s focus on European ancestry limits generalizability, but its emphasis on modifiable lifestyle factors could shift Alzheimer’s prevention narratives from genetic fatalism to actionable public health strategies."

Experiments with LED lights confirmed this eerie strategy: webs lit with firefly-like signals attracted up to ten times more prey.",

However, demographic biases remain a critical concern in FR, as these foundation models often fail to perform equitably across diverse demographic groups, considering ethnicity/race, gender, and age. Therefore, through our work DemoBias, we conduct an empirical evaluation to investigate the extent of demographic biases in LVLMs for biometric FR with textual token generation tasks.",

To address this challenge, we propose the CellINR framework, a case-specific optimization approach based on implicit neural representation. The method employs blind convolution and structure amplification strategies to map 3D spatial coordinates into the high frequency domain, enabling precise modeling and high-accuracy reconstruction of cellular structures while effectively distinguishing true signals from artifacts.",

This paper introduces CORTEX (Composite Overlay for Risk Tiering and Exposure), a multi-layered risk scoring framework proposed to assess and score AI system vulnerabilities, developed on empirical analysis of over 1,200 incidents documented in the AI Incident Database (AIID), CORTEX categorizes failure modes into 29 technical vulnerability groups. Each vulnerability is scored through a five-tier architecture that combines: (1) utility-adjusted Likelihood x Impact calculations; (2) governance + contextual overlays aligned with regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, NIST RMF, OECD principles; (3) technical surface scores, covering exposure vectors like drift, traceability, and adversarial risk; (4) environmental and residual modifiers tailored to context of where these systems are being deployed to use; and (5) a final layered assessment via Bayesian risk aggregation and Monte Carlo simulation to model volatility and long-tail risks.",

Unlike many languages, Vietnamese relies on tonal variations to distinguish word meanings, whereas English features stress patterns and non-standard pronunciations that hinder phoneme alignment between the two languages. To address this challenge, we propose a novel bilingual speech recognition approach with two primary contributions: (1) constructing a representative bilingual phoneme set that bridges the differences between Vietnamese and English phonetic systems; (2) designing an end-to-end system that leverages the PhoWhisper pre-trained encoder for deep high-level representations to improve phoneme recognition.",

However, these methods rely on fragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds, formats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for tasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based neuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and trustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with deterministic transitions.",

Unlike conventional text-prompt-based generative systems, which primarily capture high-level contextual descriptions, our approach simultaneously analyzes ground-level intuitive geometric features such as line trajectories, proportions, and spatial arrangement, and high-level semantic cues extracted via vision-language models. These dual intent signals are jointly conditioned in a multi-stage generation pipeline that combines contour-preserving structural control with style- and content-aware image synthesis.",

Unlike data-centric approaches, Model Science places the trained model at the core of analysis, aiming to interact, verify, explain, and control its behavior across diverse operational contexts. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for a new discipline called Model Science, along with the proposal for its four key pillars: Verification, which requires strict, context-aware evaluation protocols; Explanation, which is understood as various approaches to explore of internal model operations; Control, which integrates alignment techniques to steer model behavior; and Interface, which develops interactive and visual explanation tools to improve human calibration and decision-making.",

While probing techniques have shown promising signs of this in scientific and game-based settings, they rely on model-specific internal activations, which limit interpretability and generalizability.

To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a unified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning ability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed test time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of policy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter and assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO sampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training.",

In this work, we present Instructional Agents, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to automate end-to-end course material generation, including syllabus creation, lecture scripts, LaTeX-based slides, and assessments. Unlike existing AI-assisted educational tools that focus on isolated tasks, Instructional Agents simulates role-based collaboration among educational agents to produce cohesive and pedagogically aligned content.",

We instead propose modeling it as geometric and causal compositions of psychometric traits such as emotionality, openness, and agreeableness - similar to factor decomposition in psychometrics. Using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), we map activation directions to these factors and study how different combinations may give rise to sycophancy (e.g., high extraversion combined with low conscientiousness).",
