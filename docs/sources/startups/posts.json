SGS-1 achieves a higher success ratio (creating valid, watertight solids) than prior models like GPT-5 and HoLa on a benchmark of 75 complex images. The model outputs STEP files, directly editable in standard CAD software.",

      "Market — Who Loses:  Companies reliant on manual CAD processes for reverse engineering, converting sketches to 3D models, or generating parametric geometry may experience decreased demand for their services."
