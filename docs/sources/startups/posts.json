Instead of using numerous external libraries, it prioritizes building features in-house or forking and rigorously version-controlling essential external libraries (e.g., pdf.js, Mermaid, MathJax). Dependency updates are infrequent and involve extensive manual review (line-by-line changelog review, diffing, testing) before deployment.",

It uses time-based instruction scheduling to replace power-hungry CAMs, aiming for datacenter competitiveness.",

      ") Operator – Condor’s time-based instruction scheduling architecture reduces power/area overhead in out-of-order execution, but real-world performance gains must validate its departure from traditional Tomasulo’s algorithm in production workloads.",
      ") Market – If Condor succeeds, traditional x86/Arm server CPU vendors (Intel, AMD, Nvidia) lose share in customizable, open-architecture datacenter deployments, while RISC-V ecosystem players (SiFive, Ventana) gain validation for broader adoption."
