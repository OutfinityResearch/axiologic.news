Threads ads now support carousels, 4:5 formats, and simplified campaigns, with 400M monthly active users. AI-powered tools like value rules doubled high-value conversions, and landing page optimization cut cost per view by 31%.",
    "reactions": [
      ") Investor – Meta’s expansion into trending Reels and Threads ads could face risks if cultural relevance proves fleeting, as early gains in awareness (e.g., 20% lift) may not translate to sustained engagement or ROI without continuous content innovation.",
      ") Operator – The success of Threads’ carousel ads hinges on marketers mastering the 4:5 aspect ratio, as early tests show higher engagement but require adapting to a format unfamiliar to many brands.",
      ") Market – Traditional social media platforms (e.g., Twitter/X) lose if Threads’ 400M MAUs become a dominant brand-building hub, as Meta’s AI-driven targeting and trending placements pull ad spend away from competitors."

Egypt saw a 40% decline in deals (Wamda), while Saudi Arabia’s $100M round to FinTech Tamara was a rare bright spot. 2) Why it matters: The slowdown reflects tighter liquidity post-2023’s peak ($12.5B raised) and investor caution amid macroeconomic pressures.",
