Average yields on these accounts fell from 4.2% in April 2023 to 3.7% in October 2023, impacting returns for millions of users. Why it matters: This directly impacts Gen Z's investment strategies and financial planning.",

This involved adding a gradual type system, enhanced tooling (linter, type checker), performance improvements (new bytecode, interpreter, optional JIT compiler), and a revised standard library. By 2020, Roblox used >1M lines of Luau code.",
    "reactions": [
      "Investor — Roblox's massive internal use (1+MLOC by 2020) and performance improvements over LuaJIT suggest a potentially large, captive market for Luau, but its dependence on Roblox's continued success presents significant risk.",
      "Operator —  Luau's gradual typing and integrated analysis tools offer a compelling path to improving code quality and reducing bugs in large-scale projects, but maintaining backward compatibility with Lua 5.1 requires careful trade-offs.",
      "Market —  If Luau succeeds, it primarily threatens other scripting languages used in game development environments, potentially displacing them within Roblox and other applications that adopt it."
