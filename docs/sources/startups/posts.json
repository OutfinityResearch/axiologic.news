    "essence": "AI Agents as the New Growth Engine for Indian SaaS Companies Indian SaaS firms are rapidly adopting AI agents to drive operational efficiency and customer engagement, marking a shift from traditional automation to dynamic, self-learning systems. Unlike generic AI tools, these agents are being tailored for niche SaaS verticals—such as Zoho’s AI-powered sales assistants or Freshworks’ AI-driven customer support bots—which reduce response times by 40% while handling 80% of routine queries without human intervention. A key differentiator is the integration of domain-specific AI models trained on proprietary SaaS data, enabling agents to handle complex workflows (e.g., contract negotiations, lead scoring) with minimal human oversight.",

      "Investor Lens: \"AI agents in SaaS can unlock 30-50% cost savings for enterprises, but investors should scrutinize data quality and integration complexity—many Indian startups overpromise on seamless adoption.\" (Source: VC panel at SaaScon 2023)",
      "Founder Insights: \"We pivoted from generic AI tools to vertical-specific agents after realizing customers didn’t want ‘smart assistants’ but domain experts—niche focus drove 40% higher retention.\" (Founder of a B2B AI SaaS startup)",
      "Market Disruption: \"AI agents are forcing legacy SaaS players to either build or acquire capabilities, but most Indian startups lack the scale to compete with global giants like Salesforce’s Einstein.\" (Analyst at RedSeer)"
