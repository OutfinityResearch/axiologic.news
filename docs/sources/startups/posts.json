A 2023 study by the Ghana Marketing Association found 60% of consumers prefer brands that involve them in content creation, up from 35% in 2021. Companies like MTN Ghana have adopted this model, partnering with local influencers and communities to design ads, leading to a 30% increase in engagement metrics.",

The league is exploring new ad formats, such as dynamic in-game integrations and team-specific brand partnerships, following a 2023 revenue decline in local TV deals (-5% YoY per Sports Business Journal). Why it matters: This move targets brands seeking deeper fan engagement beyond traditional ads, leveraging MLB’s 70M+ digital viewers.",
    "reactions": [
      ") Investor – MLB’s expanded media rights deals (e.g., $8B+ with Disney, Fox, Turner) could pressure regional sports networks (RSNs) further, risking cord-cutting acceleration if local teams’ content becomes harder to access.",
