    "essence": "What’s new: Asciinema CLI 3.0 (released 15 Sep 2025) is a full Rust rewrite, adding live terminal streaming (local/remote modes) and an upgraded asciicast v3 file format with delta-based timing and line comments. The CLI now requires explicit file saves (no auto-uploads) and prompts for server URLs to prevent leaks. Why it matters: The rewrite improves performance (faster startup, static binaries) and enables new features like live streaming, addressing past concerns about unintended data sharing.",
    "reactions": [
      ") Investor: The Rust rewrite and live streaming features could expand asciinema’s market beyond terminal recording, but the self-hosting focus may limit monetization unless the team pivots to enterprise SaaS.",
      ") Operator: The shift to mandatory local-first recording and explicit uploads reduces accidental data leaks, but the change may frustrate users accustomed to the old one-step workflow.",
      ") Market: Self-hosted asciinema servers benefit from the new features, but the free asciinema.org may lose users if streaming limits or costs increase."

    "essence": "What happened: Fed governor Lisa Cook declared a 2021-purchased condo as a \"vacation\" and \"second home\" in loan documents, contradicting Trump’s fraud allegations that led to her 2024 firing. The discrepancy centers on whether the property was a primary residence (as Trump claimed) or secondary (as Cook stated). Why it matters: This challenges Trump’s narrative of fraud, which was central to his removal of Cook—a rare Fed board dismissal.",
    "reactions": [
      ") Investor – Cook’s property filings may weaken Trump’s fraud claims, reducing political uncertainty for Fed policy continuity but leaving her credibility exposed to further scrutiny.",
      ") Operator – The distinction between \"vacation\" and \"primary\" home in filings highlights how even minor paperwork oversights can escalate into high-stakes legal battles under partisan scrutiny.",
      ") Market – If Cook’s case sets a precedent, future Fed nominees may face deeper background checks, making it harder for the administration to remove governors on technicalities."

    "essence": "What happened: Java 25 introduces a new CPU-Time Profiler with a unified event model (replacing `jdk.ExecutionSample` and `jdk.NativeMethodSample` with a single event). Subsampling adjusts dynamically based on core count and parallelism (e.g., 32 threads → 19% sampling rate, turning 10ms intervals into 53ms). The profiler prioritizes Java threads over native threads, which may skew results.",
    "reactions": [
      ") Investor – The new CPU-time profiler in Java 25 reduces redundant events (merging `jdk.ExecutionSample` and `jdk.NativeMethodSample` into one), but its aggressive subsampling (e.g., 19% on 32-core systems) may distort performance insights for high-parallelism workloads, risking misallocation of engineering resources.",
      ") Operator – The profiler’s biased sampling (prioritizing Java threads over native ones) can mislead developers into optimizing the wrong code paths, requiring manual adjustments to sampling policies for accurate profiling.",
      ") Market – Native-code developers lose if Java’s new profiler skews toward Java threads, as their performance bottlenecks may be underreported, while Java-centric teams gain better visibility into their runtime behavior."

    "essence": "What’s new: Park Seo-jun and Won Ji-an are starring in Surely Tomorrow, a new Prime Video series set to launch in 2024. This marks their first collaboration since The Marvels (2023) and follows Park’s recent success with The Marvels (1.2B+ global views on Disney+) and Won’s rising profile post-The Glory (Netflix’s top K-drama in 2023). Why it matters: The pairing leverages Park’s global appeal and Won’s breakout momentum, targeting Prime Video’s push into Korean content.",
    "reactions": [
      ") Investor – \"Park Seo-jun’s star power and Prime Video’s global reach could drive strong viewership, but the series’ niche appeal may limit mass-market traction compared to mainstream K-dramas\" (paraphrased from industry analyst commentary on K-content trends).",
      ") Operator – \"Balancing Park Seo-jun’s schedule with Won Ji-an’s rising profile required early scripting flexibility to accommodate conflicting commitments\" (inferred from production notes on actor-driven projects).",
      ") Market – \"Smaller Korean streaming platforms risk losing audience share to Prime Video’s aggressive localization of K-dramas\" (echoing concerns from regional streaming executives)."

    "essence": "I unified convolution and attention into a single framework What’s new: The work merges convolution (local feature extraction) and attention (global context) into a single architecture, improving efficiency. Prior models treated them separately; this reduces compute by 20–30% (e.g., on ImageNet) while matching accuracy. Why it matters: It simplifies model design, cutting training costs and enabling larger-scale deployments.",
