Yale professor Edward Tufte’s analysis of the slides revealed critical flaws: misleading titles, excessive text (over 100 words per slide), vague language (\"significant\" without quantifiable data), and a hierarchical bullet-point structure that buried the most critical fact—the foam strike was 600x larger than test conditions—at the bottom.",

A prototype in Python/SQLite/DuckDB achieves ~3–5x slower performance than Soufflé (0.7s vs.",
