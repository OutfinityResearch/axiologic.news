Why it matters: This initiative aims to position websites for the emerging \"Agentic Web,\" where AI bots perform tasks on behalf of humans. It enables sites to capture an audience increasingly relying on AI for information and product research, ensuring discoverability and interoperability in an agent-driven internet.",
    "reactions": [
      ") Investor — thesis/risks: Hostinger's thesis is to capture early market share by simplifying WordPress sites for the \"Agentic Web,\" yet risks include the \"experimental\" nature of Web2Agent, fragmented AI protocols, and uncertain market adoption for AI-driven consumer tasks.",
      ") Operator — execution lesson: The lesson is to anticipate paradigm shifts, like the move to AI-agent interactions, and provide simple, one-click solutions that enable operators to quickly adapt their platforms to new user consumption patterns.",
      ") Market — who loses if they win: If the \"Agentic Web\" driven by solutions like Web2Agent succeeds, websites not optimized for AI agents will lose discoverability and engagement, becoming \"outdated\" as AI bots prioritize intelligent, interoperable platforms for consumer tasks."

      "Market: If Brave's unified AI search wins, traditional search engines and their ad-driven models lose as users obtain comprehensive answers and content directly within Brave's privacy-first interface, reducing clicks to external sites and ad exposure."
