    "essence": "Essence: The Hidden Profitability of AI Inference Contrary to the popular narrative that AI inference is a money-losing endeavor, a detailed cost breakdown reveals a stark asymmetry in compute costs between input processing and output generation. Input tokens (e.g., context windows for coding or document analysis) are effectively free—costing ~$0.003 per million tokens—while output tokens (e.g., generated text or code) cost ~$3 per million. This 1,000x cost gap flips conventional wisdom: AI inference isn’t uniformly expensive; it’s selectively expensive.",
    "reactions": [
      "Investor Lens: \"The asymmetric cost structure (input tokens near-free vs. output tokens expensive) suggests high-margin opportunities in input-heavy applications like coding assistants or document analysis, where margins can exceed 80%—a rare win for both scale and profitability.",
      "Founder Insights: \"Founders should design products that maximize input token volume (e.g., codebases, long-form documents) over output generation to leverage the cost asymmetry, as seen in Claude Code’s pricing model, which exploits this dynamic for 20x+ markups.",
      "Market Disruption: \"The revelation that inference costs are far lower than perceived could democratize AI adoption, undercutting incumbent narratives about unsustainable expenses and enabling new competitors to challenge OpenAI and Anthropic’s dominance in niche, input-heavy markets."
