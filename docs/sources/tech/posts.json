    "essence": "Innovation: Debian 13 introduces a tmpfs-based /tmp directory by default, replacing traditional disk-based storage with a RAM-backed filesystem. This change allocates up to 50% of available RAM (or 1GB if specified) to /tmp, dynamically using memory only when files are stored there. Additionally, it enforces automatic cleanup: files in /tmp are deleted after 10 days of inactivity (or 30 days for /var/tmp), reducing clutter.",
    "reactions": [
      "Contrarian View: \"This change is unnecessary for most users—traditional disk-based /tmp works fine, and tmpfs adds complexity for minimal gain, especially on systems with ample RAM where the 50% cap is arbitrary and potentially wasteful.\" (HN comment)",
      "User Experience: \"The automatic cleanup is useful, but the 10-day retention period is too long for truly temporary files, and the lack of granularity in exclusion rules may frustrate users needing predictable behavior.\" (HN comment)",
      "Industry Analysis: \"This shift reflects a broader trend toward in-memory filesystems for performance, but it risks alienating sysadmins managing legacy or resource-constrained environments where tmpfs isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution.\" (HN comment)"
